        # Request For Comments

        This form will guide you through the process for submitting a Request For Comments (RFC) for a change.

        ## Before you start

        - Make sure you search for an issue that would already cover your RFC in the [issues tab](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues?q=is%3Aissue).
        - Search through [Terragrunt documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/) to see if your RFC is already supported.

        ## After you submit

        - Share your RFC with your community for feedback and reactions! The more activity and feedback you get, the more likely it is to be reviewed by the maintainers.
        - If your RFC has enough traction, it will be reviewed by the maintainers and a decision will be made.
        - Once a decision is made, one of two things will happen:
          1. If the RFC is accepted, the `pending-decision` label will be replaced with the `accepted` label. At this stage, pull requests can be submitted by maintainers or the community to implement the RFC, with a description including `Closes #<RFC number>`.
          2. If the RFC is rejected, the `pending-decision` label will be replaced with the `rejected` label. The maintainers will provide a reason for the rejection. If applicable, it might be made clear that a new RFC with changes is welcome.
