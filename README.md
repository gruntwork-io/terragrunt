# Terragrunt

Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) that provides extra tools for keeping your 
Terraform configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. Check out
[Terragrunt: how to keep your Terraform code DRY and 
maintainable](https://blog.gruntwork.io/terragrunt-how-to-keep-your-terraform-code-dry-and-maintainable-f61ae06959d8) 
for a quick introduction to Terragrunt. 




## Quick start

1. [Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html).

1. Install Terragrunt by going to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases),
   downloading the binary for your OS, renaming it to `terragrunt`, and adding it to your PATH.
     * See the [Install Terragrunt](#install-terragrunt) docs for other installation options.

1. Go into a folder with your Terraform configurations (`.tf` files) and create a `terragrunt.hcl` file that contains 
   the configuration for Terragrunt (Terragrunt configuration uses the exact language, HCL, as Terraform). Here's an 
   example of using Terragrunt to keep your Terraform backend configuration DRY (check out the [Use cases](#use-cases) 
   section for other types of configuration Terragrunt supports):

    ```hcl
    # terragrunt.hcl example
    remote_state {
      backend = "s3"
      config = {
        bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
        key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
        region         = "us-east-1"
        encrypt        = true
        dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
      }   
    }
    ```

1. Now, instead of running `terraform` directly, run all the standard Terraform commands using `terragrunt`:

    ```bash
    terragrunt get
    terragrunt plan
    terragrunt apply
    terragrunt output
    terragrunt destroy
    ```

   Terragrunt forwards almost all commands, arguments, and options directly to Terraform, using whatever version of
   Terraform you already have installed. However, based on the settings in your `terragrunt.hcl` file, Terragrunt can
   configure remote state, locking, extra arguments, and lots more.

1. Terragrunt is a direct implementation of the ideas expressed in
   [Terraform: Up & Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com). Additional background reading that will help
   explain the motivation for Terragrunt include

## Install Terragrunt

Note that third-party Terragrunt packages may not be updated with the latest version, but are often close.
Please check your version against the latest available on the
[Releases Page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases).

### macOS
You can install Terragrunt on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install terragrunt`.

### Linux
You can install Terragrunt on Linux using [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux): `brew install terragrunt`.

### Manual
You can install Terragrunt manually by going to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases),
downloading the binary for your OS, renaming it to `terragrunt`, and adding it to your PATH.





## Migrating to Terraform 0.12 and Terragrunt 0.19.x

If you were using Terraform <= 0.11.x with Terragrunt <= 0.18.x, and you wish to upgrade to Terraform 0.12.x newer,
you'll need to upgrade to Terragrunt 0.19.x or newer. Due to some changes in Terraform 0.12.x, this is a backwards
incompatible upgrade that requires some manual migration steps. Check out our [Upgrading to Terragrunt 0.19.x 
Guide](/_docs/migration_guides/upgrading_to_terragrunt_0.19.x.md) for instructions.

## Required terraform version

We only support and test against the latest version of terraform, however older versions might still work.

## Use cases

Terragrunt supports the following use cases:

1. [Keep your Terraform code DRY](#keep-your-terraform-code-dry)
1. [Keep your remote state configuration DRY](#keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry)

#### Motivation

Consider the following file structure, which defines three environments (prod, qa, stage) with the same infrastructure
in each one (an app, a MySQL database, and a VPC):

```
└── live
    ├── prod
    │   ├── app
    │   │   └── main.tf
    │   ├── mysql
    │   │   └── main.tf
    │   └── vpc
    │       └── main.tf
    ├── qa
    │   ├── app
    │   │   └── main.tf
    │   ├── mysql
    │   │   └── main.tf
    │   └── vpc
    │       └── main.tf
    └── stage
        ├── app
        │   └── main.tf
        ├── mysql
        │   └── main.tf
        └── vpc
            └── main.tf
```

The contents of each environment will be more or less identical, except perhaps for a few settings (e.g. the prod
environment may run bigger or more servers). As the size of the infrastructure grows, having to maintain all of this
duplicated code between environments becomes more error prone. You can reduce the amount of copy paste using
[Terraform modules](https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-create-reusable-infrastructure-with-terraform-modules-25526d65f73d),
but even the code to instantiate a module and set up input variables, output variables, providers, and remote state
can still create a lot of maintenance overhead.

How can you keep your Terraform code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) so that you only
have to define it once, no matter how many environments you have?


#### Remote Terraform configurations

Terragrunt has the ability to download remote Terraform configurations. The idea is that you define the Terraform code
for your infrastructure just once, in a single repo, called, for example, `modules`:

```
└── modules
    ├── app
    │   └── main.tf
    ├── mysql
    │   └── main.tf
    └── vpc
        └── main.tf
```

This repo contains typical Terraform code, with one difference: anything in your code that should be different between
environments should be exposed as an input variable. For example, the `app` module might expose the following
variables:

```hcl
variable "instance_count" {
  description = "How many servers to run"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "What kind of servers to run (e.g. t2.large)"
}
```

These variables allow you to run smaller/fewer servers in qa and stage to save money and larger/more servers in prod to
ensure availability and scalability.

In a separate repo, called, for example, `live`, you define the code for all of your environments, which now consists
of just one `terragrunt.hcl` file per component (e.g. `app/terragrunt.hcl`, `mysql/terragrunt.hcl`, etc). This gives you
the following file layout:

```
└── live
    ├── prod
    │   ├── app
    │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    │   ├── mysql
    │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    │   └── vpc
    │       └── terragrunt.hcl
    ├── qa
    │   ├── app
    │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    │   ├── mysql
    │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    │   └── vpc
    │       └── terragrunt.hcl
    └── stage
        ├── app
        │   └── terragrunt.hcl
        ├── mysql
        │   └── terragrunt.hcl
        └── vpc
            └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Notice how there are no Terraform configurations (`.tf` files) in any of the folders. Instead, each `terragrunt.hcl` 
file specifies a `terraform { ... }` block that specifies from where to download the Terraform code, as well as the
environment-specific values for the input variables in that Terraform code. For example,
`stage/app/terragrunt.hcl` may look like this:

```hcl
terraform {
  # Deploy version v0.0.3 in stage
  source = "git::git@github.com:foo/modules.git//app?ref=v0.0.3"
}

inputs = {
  instance_count = 3
  instance_type  = "t2.micro"
}
```

*(Note: the double slash (`//`) in the `source` parameter is intentional and required. It's part of Terraform's Git 
syntax for [module sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html). Terraform may display a "Terraform 
initialized in an empty directory" warning, but you can safely ignore it.)*

And `prod/app/terragrunt.hcl` may look like this:

```hcl
terraform {
  # Deploy version v0.0.1 in prod
  source = "git::git@github.com:foo/modules.git//app?ref=v0.0.1"
}

inputs = {
  instance_count = 10
  instance_type  = "m2.large"
}
```

You can now deploy the modules in your `live` repo. For example, to deploy the `app` module in stage, you would do the 
following:

```
cd live/stage/app
terragrunt apply
```

When Terragrunt finds the `terraform` block with a `source` parameter in `live/stage/app/terragrunt.hcl` file, it will:

1. Download the configurations specified via the `source` parameter into the `--terragrunt-download-dir` folder (by
   default `.terragrunt-cache` in the working directory, which we recommend adding to `.gitignore`). This downloading
   is done by using the same [go-getter library](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) Terraform uses, so the `source`
   parameter supports the exact same syntax as the [module source](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html)
   parameter, including local file paths, Git URLs, and Git URLs with `ref` parameters (useful for checking out a
   specific tag, commit, or branch of Git repo). Terragrunt will download all the code in the repo (i.e. the part
   before the double-slash `//`) so that relative paths work correctly between modules in that repo.

1. Copy all files from the current working directory into the temporary folder.

1. Execute whatever Terraform command you specified in that temporary folder.

1. Pass any variables defined in the `inputs = { ... }` block as environment variables (prefixed with `TF_VAR_` to your 
   Terraform code. Notice how the `inputs` block in `stage/app/terragrunt.hcl` deploys fewer and smaller instances than
   prod.  


Check out the [terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example)
and [terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example)
repos for fully-working sample code that demonstrates this new folder structure.



#### Achieve DRY Terraform code and immutable infrastructure

With this new approach, copy/paste between environments is minimized. The `terragrunt.hcl` files contain solely the 
`source` URL of the module to deploy and the `inputs` to set for that module in the current environment. To create a 
new environment, you copy an old one and update just the environment-specific `inputs` in the `terragrunt.hcl` files, 
which is about as close to the "essential complexity" of the problem as you can get.

Just as importantly, since the Terraform module code is now defined in a single repo, you can version it (e.g., using Git
tags and referencing them using the `ref` parameter in the `source` URL, as in the `stage/app/terragrunt.hcl` and
`prod/app/terragrunt.hcl` examples above), and promote a single, immutable version through each environment (e.g.,
qa -> stage -> prod). This idea is inspired by Kief Morris' blog post [Using Pipelines to Manage Environments with
Infrastructure as Code](https://medium.com/@kief/https-medium-com-kief-using-pipelines-to-manage-environments-with-infrastructure-as-code-b37285a1cbf5).


#### Working locally

If you're testing changes to a local copy of the `modules` repo, you you can use the `--terragrunt-source` command-line
option or the `TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE` environment variable to override the `source` parameter. This is useful to point
Terragrunt at a local checkout of your code so you can do rapid, iterative, make-a-change-and-rerun development:

```
cd live/stage/app
terragrunt apply --terragrunt-source ../../../modules//app
```

*(Note: the double slash (`//`) here too is intentional and required. Terragrunt downloads all the code in the folder
before the double-slash into the temporary folder so that relative paths between modules work correctly. Terraform may
display a "Terraform initialized in an empty directory" warning, but you can safely ignore it.)*


#### Important gotcha: Terragrunt caching

The first time you set the `source` parameter to a remote URL, Terragrunt will download the code from that URL into a tmp folder.
It will *NOT* download it again afterwords unless you change that URL. That's because downloading code—and more importantly,
reinitializing remote state, redownloading provider plugins, and redownloading modules—can take a long time. To avoid adding 10-90
seconds of overhead to every Terragrunt command, Terragrunt assumes all remote URLs are immutable, and only downloads them once.

Therefore, when working locally, you should use the `--terragrunt-source` parameter and point it at a local file path as described
in the previous section. Terragrunt will copy the local files every time you run it, which is nearly instantaneous, and doesn't
require reinitializing everything, so you'll be able to iterate quickly.

If you need to force Terragrunt to redownload something from a remote URL, run Terragrunt with the `--terragrunt-source-update` flag
and it'll delete the tmp folder, download the files from scratch, and reinitialize everything. This can take a while, so avoid it
and use `--terragrunt-source` when you can!

#### Important gotcha: working with relative file paths

One of the gotchas with downloading Terraform configurations is that when you run `terragrunt apply` in folder `foo`,
Terraform will actually execute in some temporary folder such as `.terragrunt-cache/foo`. That means you have to be 
especially careful with relative file paths, as they will be relative to that temporary folder and not the folder where 
you ran Terragrunt!

In particular:

* **Command line**: When using file paths on the command line, such as passing an extra `-var-file` argument, you
  should use absolute paths:

    ```bash
    # Use absolute file paths on the CLI!
    terragrunt apply -var-file /foo/bar/extra.tfvars
    ```

* **Terragrunt configuration**: When using file paths directly in your Terragrunt configuration (`terragrunt.hcl`),
  such as in an `extra_arguments` block, you can't use hard-coded absolute file paths, or it won't work on your
  teammates' computers. Therefore, you should utilize the Terragrunt built-in function `get_terragrunt_dir()` to use
  a relative file path:

    ```hcl
    terraform {
      source = "git::git@github.com:foo/modules.git//frontend-app?ref=v0.0.3"

      extra_arguments "custom_vars" {
        commands = [
          "apply",
          "plan",
          "import",
          "push",
          "refresh"
        ]

        # With the get_terragrunt_dir() function, you can use relative paths!
        arguments = [
          "-var-file=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../common.tfvars",
          "-var-file=example.tfvars"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

  See the [get_terragrunt_dir()](#get_terragrunt_dir) documentation for more details.


#### Using Terragrunt with private Git repos

The easiest way to use Terragrunt with private Git repos is to use SSH authentication.
Configure your Git account so you can use it with SSH
(see the [guide for GitHub here](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/))
and use the SSH URL for your repo, prepended with `git::ssh://`:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git::ssh://git@github.com/foo/modules.git//path/to/module?ref=v0.0.1"
}
```
Look up the Git repo for your repository to find the proper format.

Note: In automated pipelines, you may need to run the following command for your
Git repository prior to calling `terragrunt` to ensure that the ssh host is registered
locally, e.g.:

```
$ ssh -T -oStrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new git@github.com || true
```


### Keep your remote state configuration DRY

* [Motivation](#motivation-1)
* [Filling in remote state settings with Terragrunt](#filling-in-remote-state-settings-with-terragrunt)
* [Create remote state and locking resources automatically](#create-remote-state-and-locking-resources-automatically)


#### Motivation

Terraform supports [remote state storage](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html) via a variety of
[backends](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends) that you normally configure in your `.tf` files as follows:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "frontend-app/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
  }
}
```

Unfortunately, the `backend` configuration does not support expressions, variables, or functions. This makes it hard to 
keep your code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) if you have multiple Terraform modules. For 
example, consider the following folder structure, which uses different Terraform modules to deploy a backend app, 
frontend app, MySQL database, and a VPC:

```
├── backend-app
│   └── main.tf
├── frontend-app
│   └── main.tf
├── mysql
│   └── main.tf
└── vpc
    └── main.tf
```

To use remote state with each of these modules, you would have to copy/paste the exact same `backend` configuration
into each of the `main.tf` files. The only thing that would differ between the configurations would be the `key`
parameter: e.g., the `key` for `mysql/main.tf` might be `mysql/terraform.tfstate` and the `key` for
`frontend-app/main.tf` might be `frontend-app/terraform.tfstate`.

To keep your remote state configuration DRY, you can use Terragrunt. You still have to specify the `backend` you want
to use in each module, but instead of copying and pasting the configuration settings over and over again into each
`main.tf` file, you can leave them blank (this is known as [partial 
configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/config.html#partial-configuration)):

```hcl
terraform {
  # The configuration for this backend will be filled in by Terragrunt
  backend "s3" {}
}
```


#### Filling in remote state settings with Terragrunt

To fill in the settings via Terragrunt, create a `terragrunt.hcl` file in the root folder, plus one `terragrunt.hcl`
file in each of the Terraform modules:

```
├── terragrunt.hcl
├── backend-app
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── frontend-app
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── mysql
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── vpc
    ├── main.tf
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

In your **root** `terragrunt.hcl` file, you can define your entire remote state configuration just once in a
`remote_state` block (which supports all the same [backend types](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/index.html)
as Terraform), as follows:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
  }
}
```

In each of the **child** `terragrunt.hcl` files, such as `mysql/terragrunt.hcl`, you can tell Terragrunt to
automatically include all the settings from the root `terragrunt.hcl` file as follows:

```hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

The `include` block tells Terragrunt to use the exact same Terragrunt configuration from the `terragrunt.hcl` file
specified via the `path` parameter. It behaves exactly as if you had copy/pasted the Terraform configuration from
the included file `remote_state` configuration into `mysql/terragrunt.hcl`, but this approach is much easier to 
maintain!

The next time you run `terragrunt`, it will automatically configure all the settings in the
`remote_state.config` block, if they aren't configured already, by calling [terraform
init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html).

The `terragrunt.hcl` files above use two Terragrunt built-in functions:

* `find_in_parent_folders()`: This function returns the path to the first `terragrunt.hcl` file it finds in the parent
  folders above the current `terragrunt.hcl` file. In the example above, the call to `find_in_parent_folders()` in
  `mysql/terragrunt.hcl` will return `../terragrunt.hcl`. This way, you don't have to hard code the `path`
  parameter in every module.

* `path_relative_to_include()`: This function returns the relative path between the current `terragrunt.hcl`
  file and the path specified in its `include` block. We typically use this in a root `terragrunt.hcl` file so that
  each Terraform child module stores its Terraform state at a different `key`. For example, the `mysql` module will
  have its `key` parameter resolve to `mysql/terraform.tfstate` and the `frontend-app` module will have its `key`
  parameter resolve to `frontend-app/terraform.tfstate`.

See [the Built-in Functions docs](#built-in-functions) for more info.

Check out the [terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example)
and [terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example)
repos for fully-working sample code that demonstrates how to use Terragrunt to manage remote state.


#### Rules for merging parent and child configurations 

The child `.hcl` file's `terraform` settings will be merged into the parent file's `terraform` settings as follows:

* If an `extra_arguments` block in the child has the same name as an `extra_arguments` block in the parent,
  then the child's block will override the parent's.
  * Specifying an empty `extra_arguments` block in a child with the same name will effectively remove the parent's block.
* If an `extra_arguments` block in the child has a different name than `extra_arguments` blocks in the parent,
  then both the parent and child's `extra_arguments` will be effective.
  * The child's `extra_arguments` will be placed _after_ the parent's `extra_arguments` on the terraform command line.
  * Therefore, if a child's and parent's `extra_arguments` include `.tfvars` files with the same variable defined,
    the value from the `.tfvars` file from the child's `extra_arguments` will be used by terraform.
* If a `before_hook` or `after_hook` block in the child has the same name as the hook block in the parent,
  then the child's block will override the parent's.
  * Specifying an empty hook block in a child with the same name will effectively remove the parent's block.
* If a `before_hook` or `after_hook` block in the child has a different name than hook blocks in the parent,
  then both the parent and child's hook blocks will be effective.
* The `source` field in the child will override `source` field in the parent

Other settings in the child `.hcl` file override the respective settings in the parent.


#### Create remote state and locking resources automatically

When you run `terragrunt` with `remote_state` configuration, it will automatically create the following resources if
they don't already exist:

* **S3 bucket**: If you are using the [S3 backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html) for remote
  state storage and the `bucket` you specify in `remote_state.config` doesn't already exist, Terragrunt will create it
  automatically, with [versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html), 
  [server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html), and 
  [access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html) enabled.

  In addition, you can let terragrunt tag the bucket with custom tags that you specify in
  `remote_state.config.s3_bucket_tags`.

* **DynamoDB table**: If you are using the [S3 backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html) for
  remote state storage and you specify a `dynamodb_table` (a [DynamoDB table used for
  locking](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html#dynamodb_table)) in `remote_state.config`, if that table
  doesn't already exist, Terragrunt will create it automatically, with 
  [server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/EncryptionAtRest.html) 
  enabled, including a primary key called `LockID`.

  In addition, you can let terragrunt tag the DynamoDB table with custom tags that you specify in
  `remote_state.config.dynamodb_table_tags`.
  
- **GCS bucket**: If you are using the [GCS backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/gcs.html) for remote
  state storage and the `bucket` you specify in `remote_state.config` doesn't already exist, Terragrunt will create it
  automatically, with [versioning](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning) enabled. For this to work
  correctly you must also specify `project` and `location` keys in `remote_state.config`, so terragrunt knows where to
  create the bucket. You will also need to supply valid credentials using either `remote_state.config.credentials` or by
  setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. If you want to skip creating the bucket entirely,
  simply set `skip_bucket_creation` to `true` and Terragrunt will assume the bucket has already been created. If you
  don't specify `bucket` in `remote_state` then terragrunt will assume that you will pass `bucket` through
  `-backend-config` in `extra_arguments`.

  We also strongly recommend you enable [Cloud Audit Logs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-logs) to audit
  and track API operations performed against the state bucket.

  In addition, you can let Terragrunt label the bucket with custom labels that you specify in
  `remote_state.config.gcs_bucket_labels`.

**Note**: If you specify a `profile` key in `remote_state.config`, Terragrunt will automatically use this AWS profile
when creating the S3 bucket or DynamoDB table.

**Note**: You can disable automatic remote state initialization by setting `remote_state.disable_init`, this will
skip the automatic creation of remote state resources and will execute `terraform init` passing the `backend=false` option.
This can be handy when running commands such as `validate-all` as part of a CI process where you do not want to initialize remote state.

The following example demonstrates using an environment variable to configure this option:

```hcl
remote_state {
  # ...

  disable_init = tobool(get_env("TERRAGRUNT_DISABLE_INIT", "false"))
}
```

#### S3-specific remote state settings

For the `s3` backend, the following config options can be used for S3-compatible object stores, as necessary:

```hcl
remote_state {
  # ...

  skip_bucket_versioning         = true # use only if the object store does not support versioning
  skip_bucket_ssencryption       = true # use only if non-encrypted Terraform State is required and/or the object store does not support server-side encryption
  skip_bucket_accesslogging      = true # use only if the cost for the extra object space is undesirable or the object store does not support access logging
  enable_lock_table_ssencryption = true # use only if non-encrypted DynamoDB Lock Table for the Terraform State is required and/or the NoSQL database service does not support server-side encryption

  shared_credentials_file     = "/path/to/credentials/file"
  skip_credentials_validation = true
  skip_metadata_api_check     = true
  force_path_style            = true
}
```

If you experience an error for any of these configurations, confirm you are using Terraform v0.12.2 or greater.

Further, the config options `s3_bucket_tags`, `dynamodb_table_tags`, `skip_bucket_versioning`,
`skip_bucket_ssencryption`, `skip_bucket_accesslogging`, and `enable_lock_table_ssencryption` are only valid for 
backend `s3`. They are used by terragrunt and are **not** passed on to
terraform. See section [Create remote state and locking resources automatically](#create-remote-state-and-locking-resources-automatically).


#### GCS-specific remote state settings

For the `gcs` backend, the following config options can be used for GCS-compatible object stores, as necessary:

```hcl
remote_state {
 # ...

 skip_bucket_versioning = true # use only if the object store does not support versioning

 encryption_key = "GOOGLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"
}
```

If you experience an error for any of these configurations, confirm you are using Terraform v0.12.0 or greater.

Further, the config options `gcs_bucket_labels` and `skip_bucket_versioning` are only valid for the backend `gcs`. They are used by
terragrunt and are **not** passed on to terraform. See section [Create remote state and locking resources automatically](#create-remote-state-and-locking-resources-automatically).

### Keep your CLI flags DRY

* [Motivation](#motivation-2)
* [Multiple extra_arguments blocks](#multiple-extra_arguments-blocks)
* [extra_arguments for init](#extra_arguments-for-init)
* [Required and optional var-files](#required-and-optional-var-files)
* [Handling whitespace](#handling-whitespace)

#### Motivation

Sometimes you may need to pass extra CLI arguments every time you run certain `terraform` commands. For example, you
may want to set the `lock-timeout` setting to 20 minutes for all commands that may modify remote state so that
Terraform will keep trying to acquire a lock for up to 20 minutes if someone else already has the lock rather than
immediately exiting with an error.

You can configure Terragrunt to pass specific CLI arguments for specific commands using an `extra_arguments` block
in your `terragrunt.hcl` file:

```hcl
terraform {
  # Force Terraform to keep trying to acquire a lock for
  # up to 20 minutes if someone else already has the lock
  extra_arguments "retry_lock" {
    commands = [
      "init",
      "apply",
      "refresh",
      "import",
      "plan",
      "taint",
      "untaint"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-lock-timeout=20m"
    ]

    env_vars = {
      TF_VAR_var_from_environment = "value"
    }
  }
}
```

Each `extra_arguments` block includes an arbitrary name (in the example above, `retry_lock`), a list of `commands` to
which the extra arguments should be added, and a list of `arguments` or `required_var_files` or `optional_var_files` to 
add. You can also pass custom environment variables using `env_vars` block, which stores environment variables in key 
value pairs. With the configuration above, when you run `terragrunt apply`, Terragrunt will call Terraform as follows:

```
$ terragrunt apply

terraform apply -lock-timeout=20m
```

You can even use built-in functions such as 
[get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking](#get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking) to automatically populate the
lsit of Terraform commands that need locking:

```hcl
terraform {
  # Force Terraform to keep trying to acquire a lock for up to 20 minutes if someone else already has the lock
  extra_arguments "retry_lock" {
    commands  = get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking()
    arguments = ["-lock-timeout=20m"]
  }
}
```



#### Multiple extra_arguments blocks

You can specify one or more `extra_arguments` blocks. The `arguments` in each block will be applied any time you call
`terragrunt` with one of the commands in the `commands` list. If more than one `extra_arguments` block matches a
command, the arguments will be added in the order of appearance in the configuration. For example, in addition to
lock settings, you may also want to pass custom `-var-file` arguments to several commands:

```hcl
terraform {
  # Force Terraform to keep trying to acquire a lock for
  # up to 20 minutes if someone else already has the lock
  extra_arguments "retry_lock" {
    commands  = get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking()
    arguments = ["-lock-timeout=20m"]
  }

  # Pass custom var files to Terraform
  extra_arguments "custom_vars" {
    commands = [
      "apply",
      "plan",
      "import",
      "push",
      "refresh"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-var", "foo=bar",
      "-var", "region=us-west-1"
    ]
  }
}
```

With the configuration above, when you run `terragrunt apply`, Terragrunt will call Terraform as follows:

```
$ terragrunt apply

terraform apply -lock-timeout=20m -var foo=bar -var region=us-west-1
```

#### `extra_arguments` for `init`

Extra arguments for the `init` command have some additional behavior and constraints.

In addition to being appended to the `terraform init` command that is run when you explicitly run `terragrunt init`,
`extra_arguments` for `init` will also be appended to the `init` commands that are automatically
run during other commands (see [Auto-Init](#auto-init)).

You must _not_ specify the `-from-module` option (aka. the `SOURCE` argument for terraform < 0.10.0) or the `DIR` 
argument in the `extra_arguments` for `init`. This option and argument will be provided automatically by terragrunt.

Here's an example of configuring `extra_arguments` for `init` in an environment in which terraform plugins are manually installed,
rather than relying on terraform to automatically download them.

```hcl
terraform {
  # ...

  extra_arguments "init_args" {
    commands = [
      "init"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-get-plugins=false",
      "-plugin-dir=/my/terraform/plugin/dir",
    ]
  }
}
```


#### Required and optional var-files

One common usage of extra_arguments is to include tfvars files. Instead of using arguments, it is simpler to use 
either `required_var_files` or `optional_var_files`. Both options require only to provide the list of file to include. 
The only difference is that `required_var_files` will add the extra argument `-var-file=<your file>` for each file 
specified and if they don't exist, exit with an error. `optional_var_files`, on the other hand, will skip over files
that don't exists. This allows many conditional configurations based on environment variables as you can see in the 
following example:

```
/my/tf
├── terragrunt.hcl
├── prod.tfvars
├── us-west-2.tfvars
├── backend-app
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── dev.tfvars
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── frontend-app
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── us-east-1.tfvars
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
```

```hcl
terraform {
  extra_arguments "conditional_vars" {
    commands = [
      "apply",
      "plan",
      "import",
      "push",
      "refresh"
    ]

    required_var_files = [
      "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/terraform.tfvars"
    ]

    optional_var_files = [
      "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/${get_env("TF_VAR_env", "dev")}.tfvars",
      "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/${get_env("TF_VAR_region", "us-east-1")}.tfvars",
      "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${get_env("TF_VAR_env", "dev")}.tfvars",
      "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${get_env("TF_VAR_region", "us-east-1")}.tfvars"
    ]
  }
```

See the [get_terragrunt_dir()](#get_terragrunt_dir) and [get_parent_terragrunt_dir()](#get_parent_terragrunt_dir) documentation 
for more details.

With the configuration above, when you run `terragrunt apply-all`, Terragrunt will call Terraform as follows:

```
$ terragrunt apply-all
[backend-app]  terraform apply -var-file=/my/tf/terraform.tfvars -var-file=/my/tf/backend-app/dev.tfvars
[frontend-app] terraform apply -var-file=/my/tf/terraform.tfvars -var-file=/my/tf/frontend-app/us-east-1.tfvars

$ TF_VAR_env=prod terragrunt apply-all
[backend-app]  terraform apply -var-file=/my/tf/terraform.tfvars -var-file=/my/tf/prod.tfvars
[frontend-app] terraform apply -var-file=/my/tf/terraform.tfvars -var-file=/my/tf/prod.tfvars -var-file=/my/tf/frontend-app/us-east-1.tfvars

$ TF_VAR_env=prod TF_VAR_region=us-west-2 terragrunt apply-all
[backend-app]  terraform apply -var-file=/my/tf/terraform.tfvars -var-file=/my/tf/prod.tfvars -var-file=/my/tf/us-west-2.tfvars
[frontend-app] terraform apply -var-file=/my/tf/terraform.tfvars -var-file=/my/tf/prod.tfvars -var-file=/my/tf/us-west-2.tfvars
```

#### Handling whitespace

The list of arguments cannot include whitespaces, so if you need to pass command line arguments that include
spaces (e.g. `-var bucket=example.bucket.name`), then each of the arguments will need to be a separate item in the
`arguments` list:

```hcl
terraform {
  extra_arguments "bucket" {
    commands = [
      "apply",
      "plan",
      "import",
      "push",
      "refresh"
    ]
    
    arguments = [
      "-var", "bucket=example.bucket.name",
    ]
  }
}
```

With the configuration above, when you run `terragrunt apply`, Terragrunt will call Terraform as follows:

```
$ terragrunt apply

terraform apply -var bucket=example.bucket.name
```


### Execute Terraform commands on multiple modules at once

* [Motivation](#motivation-3)
* [The apply-all, destroy-all, output-all and plan-all commands](#the-apply-all-destroy-all-output-all-and-plan-all-commands)
* [Passing outputs between modules](#passing-outputs-between-modules)
* [Dependencies between modules](#dependencies-between-modules)
* [Testing multiple modules locally](#testing-multiple-modules-locally)


#### Motivation

Let's say your infrastructure is defined across multiple Terraform modules:

```
root
├── backend-app
│   └── main.tf
├── frontend-app
│   └── main.tf
├── mysql
│   └── main.tf
├── redis
│   └── main.tf
└── vpc
    └── main.tf
```

There is one module to deploy a frontend-app, another to deploy a backend-app, another for the MySQL database, and so
on. To deploy such an environment, you'd have to manually run `terraform apply` in each of the subfolder, wait for it
to complete, and then run `terraform apply` in the next subfolder. How do you avoid this tedious and time-consuming
process?


#### The apply-all, destroy-all, output-all and plan-all commands

To be able to deploy multiple Terraform modules in a single command, add a `terragrunt.hcl` file to each module:

```
root
├── backend-app
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── frontend-app
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── mysql
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── redis
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── vpc
    ├── main.tf
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Now you can go into the `root` folder and deploy all the modules within it by using the `apply-all` command:

```
cd root
terragrunt apply-all
```

When you run this command, Terragrunt will recursively look through all the subfolders of the current working
directory, find all folders with a `terragrunt.hcl` file, and run `terragrunt apply` in each of those folders 
concurrently.

Similarly, to undeploy all the Terraform modules, you can use the `destroy-all` command:

```
cd root
terragrunt destroy-all
```

To see the currently applied outputs of all of the subfolders, you can use the `output-all` command:

```
cd root
terragrunt output-all
```

Finally, if you make some changes to your project, you could evaluate the impact by using `plan-all` command:

Note: It is important to realize that you could get errors running `plan-all` if you have dependencies between your 
projects and some of those dependencies haven't been applied yet.

_Ex: If module A depends on module B and module B hasn't been applied yet, then plan-all will show the plan for B,
but exit with an error when trying to show the plan for A._

```
cd root
terragrunt plan-all
```

If your modules have dependencies between them—for example, you can't deploy the backend-app until MySQL and redis are
deployed—you'll need to express those dependencies in your Terragrunt configuration as explained in the next section.


#### Passing outputs between modules

Consider the following file structure:

```
root
├── backend-app
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── mysql
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── redis
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── vpc
    ├── main.tf
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Suppose that you wanted to pass in the VPC ID of the VPC that is created from the `vpc` module in the folder structure
above to the `mysql` module as an input variable. Or if you wanted to pass in the subnet IDs of the private subnet that
is allocated as part of the `vpc` module.

You can use the `dependency` block to extract the output variables to access another module's output variables in
the terragrunt `inputs` attribute.

For example, suppose the `vpc` module outputs the ID under the name `vpc_id`. To access that output, you would specify
in `mysql/terragrunt.hcl`:

```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"
}

inputs = {
  vpc_id = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
}
```

When you apply this module, the output will be read from the `vpc` module and passed in as an input to the `mysql`
module right before calling `terraform apply`.

You can also specify multiple `dependency` blocks to access multiple different module output variables. For
example, in the above folder structure, you might want to reference the `domain` output of the `redis` and `mysql`
modules for use as `inputs` in the `backend-app` module. To access those outputs, you would specify in
`backend-app/terragrunt.hcl`:

```
dependency "mysql" {
  config_path = "../mysql"
}

dependency "redis" {
  config_path = "../redis"
}

inputs = {
  mysql_url = dependency.mysql.outputs.domain
  redis_url = dependency.redis.outputs.domain
}
```

Note that each `dependency` is automatically considered a dependency in Terragrunt. This means that when you run
`apply-all` on a config that has `dependency` blocks, Terragrunt will not attempt to deploy the config until all
the modules referenced in `dependency` blocks have been applied. So for the above example, the order for the
`apply-all` command would be:

1. Deploy the VPC
1. Deploy MySQL and Redis in parallel
1. Deploy the backend-app

If any of the modules failed to deploy, then Terragrunt will not attempt to deploy the modules that depend on them.

**Note**: Not all blocks are able to access outputs passed by `dependency` blocks. See the section on
[Configuration parsing order](#configuration-parsing-order) in this README for more information.

##### Unapplied dependency and mock outputs

Terragrunt will return an error indicating the dependency hasn't been applied yet if the terraform module managed by the
terragrunt config referenced in a `dependency` block has not been applied yet. This is because you cannot actually fetch
outputs out of an unapplied Terraform module, even if there are no resources being created in the module.

This is most problematic when running commands that do not modify state (e.g `plan-all` and `validate-all`) on a
completely new setup where no infrastructure has been deployed. You won't be able to `plan` or `validate` a module if
you can't determine the `inputs`. If the module depends on the outputs of another module that hasn't been applied
yet, you won't be able to compute the `inputs` unless the dependencies are all applied. However, in real life usage, you
would want to run `validate-all` or `plan-all` on a completely new set of infrastructure.

To address this, you can provide mock outputs to use when a module hasn't been applied yet. This is configured using
the `mock_outputs` attribute on the `dependency` block and it corresponds to a map that will be injected in place of
the actual dependency outputs if the target config hasn't been applied yet.

For example, in the previous example with a `mysql` module and `vpc` module, suppose you wanted to place in a temporary,
dummy value for the `vpc_id` during a `validate-all` for the `mysql` module. You can specify in `mysql/terragrunt.hcl`:

```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"

  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_id = "temporary-dummy-id"
  }
}

inputs = {
  vpc_id = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
}
```

You can now run `validate` on this config before the `vpc` module is applied because Terragrunt will use the map
`{vpc_id = "temporary-dummy-id"}` as the `outputs` attribute on the dependency instead of erroring out.

What if you wanted to restrict this behavior to only the `validate` command? For example, you might not want to use
the defaults for a `plan` operation because the plan doesn't give you any indication of what is actually going to be
created.

You can use the `mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands` attribute to indicate that the `mock_outputs` should
only be used when running those Terraform commands. So to restrict the `mock_outputs` to only when `validate` is
being run, you can modify the above `terragrunt.hcl` file to:

```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"

  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_id = "temporary-dummy-id"
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate"]
}

inputs = {
  vpc_id = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
}
```

Note that indicating `validate` means that the `mock_outputs` will be used either with `validate` or with
`validate-all`.

You can also use `skip_outputs` on the `dependency` block to specify the dependency without pulling in the outputs:

```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"
  skip_outputs = true
}
```

<!--
This currently makes no sense to do, but will make more sense when `dependency` blocks start to pull in other
information from the target config.
-->


#### Dependencies between modules

You can also specify dependencies explicitly. Consider the following file structure:

```
root
├── backend-app
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── frontend-app
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── mysql
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── redis
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── vpc
    ├── main.tf
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Let's assume you have the following dependencies between Terraform modules:

* `backend-app` depends on `mysql`, `redis`, and `vpc`
* `frontend-app` depends on `backend-app` and `vpc`
* `mysql` depends on `vpc`
* `redis` depends on `vpc`
* `vpc` has no dependencies

You can express these dependencies in your `terragrunt.hcl` config files using a `dependencies` block. For example,
in `backend-app/terragrunt.hcl` you would specify:

```hcl
dependencies {
  paths = ["../vpc", "../mysql", "../redis"]
}
```

Similarly, in `frontend-app/terragrunt.hcl`, you would specify:

```hcl
dependencies {
  paths = ["../vpc", "../backend-app"]
}
```

Once you've specified the dependencies in each `terragrunt.hcl` file, when you run the `terragrunt apply-all` or
`terragrunt destroy-all`, Terragrunt will ensure that the dependencies are applied or destroyed, respectively, in the
correct order. For the example at the start of this section, the order for the `apply-all` command would be:

1. Deploy the VPC
1. Deploy MySQL and Redis in parallel
1. Deploy the backend-app
1. Deploy the frontend-app

If any of the modules fail to deploy, then Terragrunt will not attempt to deploy the modules that depend on them. Once
you've fixed the error, it's usually safe to re-run the `apply-all` or `destroy-all` command again, since it'll be a
no-op for the modules that already deployed successfully, and should only affect the ones that had an error the last
time around.

To check all of your dependencies and validate the code in them, you can use the `validate-all` command.


#### Testing multiple modules locally

If you are using Terragrunt to configure [remote Terraform configurations](#remote-terraform-configurations) and all
of your modules have the `source` parameter set to a Git URL, but you want to test with a local checkout of the code,
you can use the `--terragrunt-source` parameter:


```
cd root
terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-source /source/modules
```

If you set the `--terragrunt-source` parameter, the `xxx-all` commands will assume that parameter is pointing to a
folder on your local file system that has a local checkout of all of your Terraform modules. For each module that is
being processed via a `xxx-all` command, Terragrunt will read in the `source` parameter in that module's `terragrunt.hcl`
file, parse out the path (the portion after the double-slash), and append the path to the `--terragrunt-source`
parameter to create the final local path for that module.

For example, consider the following `terragrunt.hcl` file:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:acme/infrastructure-modules.git//networking/vpc?ref=v0.0.1"
}
```

If you run `terragrunt apply-all --terragrunt-source /source/infrastructure-modules`, then the local path Terragrunt
will compute for the module above will be `/source/infrastructure-modules//networking/vpc`.




### Work with multiple AWS accounts

#### Motivation

The most secure way to manage infrastructure in AWS is to use [multiple AWS
accounts](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-multi-account-security-strategy/). You define all your
IAM users in one account (e.g., the "security" account) and deploy all of your infrastructure into a number of other
accounts (e.g., the "dev", "stage", and "prod" accounts). To access those accounts, you login to the security account
and [assume an IAM role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-roles.html) in the other accounts.

There are a few ways to assume IAM roles when using AWS CLI tools, such as Terraform:

1. One option is to create a named [profile](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html),
   each with a different [role_arn](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-roles.html) parameter. You then
   tell Terraform which profile to use via the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. The downside to using profiles is
   that you have to store your AWS credentials in plaintext on your hard drive.

1. Another option is to use environment variables and the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). You first set the
   credentials for the security account (the one where your IAM users are defined) as the environment variables
   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and run `aws sts assume-role --role-arn <ROLE>`. This gives you
   back a blob of JSON that contains new `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` values you can set as
   environment variables to allow Terraform to use that role. The advantage of this approach is that you can store your
   AWS credentials in a secret store and never write them to disk in plaintext. The disadvantage is that assuming an
   IAM role requires several tedious steps. Worse yet, the credentials you get back from the `assume-role` command are
   only good for up to 1 hour, so you have to repeat this process often.

1. A final option is to modify your AWS provider with the [assume_role
   configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/#assume-role) and your S3 backend with the [role_arn
   parameter](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html#role_arn). You can then set the credentials for the
   security account (the one where your IAM users are defined) as the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and when you run `terraform apply` or `terragrunt apply`, Terraform/Terragrunt will assume
   the IAM role you specify automatically. The advantage of this approach is that you can store your
   AWS credentials in a secret store and never write them to disk in plaintext, and you get fresh credentials on every
   run of `apply`, without the complexity of calling `assume-role`. The disadvantage is that you have to modify all
   your Terraform / Terragrunt code to set the `role_arn` param and your Terraform backend configuration will change
   (and prompt you to manually confirm the update!) every time you change the IAM role you're using.

To avoid these frustrating trade-offs, you can configure Terragrunt to assume an IAM role for you, as described next.


#### Configuring Terragrunt to assume an IAM role

To tell Terragrunt to assume an IAM role, just set the `--terragrunt-iam-role` command line argument:

```bash
terragrunt apply --terragrunt-iam-role "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
```

Alternatively, you can set the `TERRAGRUNT_IAM_ROLE` environment variable:

```bash
export TERRAGRUNT_IAM_ROLE="arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
terragrunt apply
```

Additionally, you can specify an `iam_role` property in the terragrunt config:

```hcl
iam_role = "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
```

Terragrunt will resolve the value of the option by first looking for the cli argument, then looking for the environment
variable, then defaulting to the value specified in the config file.

Terragrunt will call the `sts assume-role` API on your behalf and expose the credentials it gets back as environment
variables when running Terraform. The advantage of this approach is that you can store your AWS credentials in a secret
store and never write them to disk in plaintext, you get fresh credentials on every run of Terragrunt, without the
complexity of calling `assume-role` yourself, and you don't have to modify your Terraform code or backend configuration
at all.

1. [Contributing](#contributing)
1. [Developing Terragrunt](#developing-terragrunt)
1. [License](#license)


### Inputs

You can set values for your module's input parameters by specifying an `inputs` block in `terragrunt.hcl`:

```hcl
inputs = {
  instance_type  = "t2.micro"
  instance_count = 10

  tags = {
    Name = "example-app"
  }
}
```

Whenever you run a Terragrunt command, Terragrunt will set any inputs you pass in as environment variables. For example,
with the `terragrunt.hcl` file above, running `terragrunt apply` is roughly equivalent to:

```
$ terragrunt apply

# Roughly equivalent to:

TF_VAR_instance_type="t2.micro" \
TF_VAR_instance_count=10 \
TF_VAR_tags='{"Name":"example-app"}' \
terraform apply
```

Note that Terragrunt will respect any `TF_VAR_xxx` variables you've manually set in your environment, ensuring that 
anything in `inputs` will NOT be override anything you've already set in your environment.  


### Locals

You can use locals to bind a name to an expression, so you can reuse that expression without having to repeat it multiple times (keeping your Terragrunt configuration DRY).
config. For example, suppose that you need to use the AWS region in multiple inputs. You can bind the name `aws_region`
using locals:

```
locals {
  aws_region = "us-east-1"
}

inputs = {
  aws_region  = local.aws_region
  s3_endpoint = "com.amazonaws.${local.aws_region}.s3"
}
```

You can use any valid terragrunt expression in the `locals` configuration. The `locals` block also supports referencing other `locals`:

```
locals {
  x = 2
  y = 40
  answer = local.x + local.y
}
```

##### Including globally defined locals

Currently you can only reference `locals` defined in the same config file. `terragrunt` does not automatically include
`locals` defined in the parent config of an `include` block into the current context. If you wish to reuse variables
globally, consider using `yaml` or `json` files that are included and merged using the `terraform` built in functions
available to `terragrunt`.

For example, suppose you had the following directory tree:

```
.
├── terragrunt.hcl
├── mysql
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── vpc
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Instead of adding the `locals` block to the parent `terragrunt.hcl` file, you can define a file `common_vars.yaml`
that contains the global variables you wish to pull in:

```
.
├── terragrunt.hcl
├── common_vars.yaml
├── mysql
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── vpc
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

You can then include them into the `locals` block of the child terragrunt config using `yamldecode` and `file`:

```
# child terragrunt.hcl
locals {
  common_vars = yamldecode(file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("common_vars.yaml")}")),
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

This configuration will load in the `common_vars.yaml` file and bind it to the attribute `common_vars` so that it is available
in the current context. Note that because `locals` is a block, there currently is a way to merge the map into the top
level.


### AWS credentials

Terragrunt uses the official [AWS SDK for Go](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/), which
means that it will automatically load credentials using the
[AWS standard approach](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/a-new-and-standardized-way-to-manage-credentials-in-the-aws-sdks/). 
If you need help configuring your credentials, please refer to the [Terraform 
docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/#authentication).


### AWS IAM policies

Your AWS user must have an [IAM policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/access-control-identity-based.html)
which grants permissions for interacting with DynamoDB and S3. Terragrunt will automatically create
the configured DynamoDB tables and S3 buckets for storing remote state if they do not already exist.

The following is an example IAM policy for use with Terragrunt. The policy grants the following permissions:

* all DynamoDB permissions in all regions for tables used by Terragrunt
* all S3 permissions for buckets used by Terragrunt

Before using this policy, make sure to replace `1234567890` with your AWS account id and `terragrunt*` with
your organization's naming convention for AWS resources for Terraform remote state.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAllDynamoDBActionsOnAllTerragruntTables",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "dynamodb:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:*:1234567890:table/terragrunt*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAllS3ActionsOnTerragruntBuckets",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::terragrunt*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::terragrunt*/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

For a more minimal policy, for example when using a single bucket and DynamoDB table for multiple Terragrunt
users, you can use the following. Be sure to replace `BUCKET_NAME` and `TABLE_NAME` with the S3 bucket name
and DynamoDB table name respectively.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCreateAndListS3ActionsOnSpecifiedTerragruntBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
                "s3:CreateBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowGetAndPutS3ActionsOnSpecifiedTerragruntBucketPath",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/some/path/here"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCreateAndUpdateDynamoDBActionsOnSpecifiedTerragruntTable",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                "dynamodb:CreateTable"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:*:*:table/TABLE_NAME"
        }
    ]
}
```

When the above is applied to an IAM user it will restrict them to creating the DynamoDB table if it doesn't
already exist and allow updating records for state locking, and for the S3 bucket will allow creating the
bucket if it doesn't already exist and only write files to the specified path.

### Built-in Functions

Terragrunt allows you to use built-in functions anywhere in `terragrunt.hcl`, just like Terraform! The functions 
currently available are: 

* [All Terraform built-in functions](#terraform-built-in-functions)
* [find_in_parent_folders()](#find_in_parent_folders)
* [path_relative_to_include()](#path_relative_to_include)
* [path_relative_from_include()](#path_relative_from_include)
* [get_env(NAME, DEFAULT)](#get_env)
* [get_terragrunt_dir()](#get_terragrunt_dir)
* [get_parent_terragrunt_dir()](#get_parent_terragrunt_dir)
* [get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()](#get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars)
* [get_terraform_commands_that_need_input()](#get_terraform_commands_that_need_input)
* [get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking()](#get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking)
* [get_terraform_commands_that_need_parallelism()](#get_terraform_commands_that_need_parallelism)
* [get_aws_account_id()](#get_aws_account_id)
* [run_cmd()](#run_cmd)


#### Terraform built-in functions

All [Terraform built-in functions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions.html) are supported in
Terragrunt config files:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "../modules/${basename(get_terragrunt_dir())}"
}

remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = trimspace("   my-terraform-bucket     ")
    region = join("-", ["us", "east", "1"])
    key    = format("%s/terraform.tfstate", path_relative_to_include())
  }
}
```

Note: Any `file*` functions (`file`, `fileexists`, `filebase64`, etc) are relative to the directory containing the
`terragrunt.hcl` file they're used in.

Given the following structure:
```
└── terragrunt
  └── common.tfvars
  ├── assets
  |  └── mysql
  |     └── assets.txt
  └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Then `assets.txt` could be read with the following function call:
```hcl
file("assets/mysql/assets.txt")
```


#### find_in_parent_folders

`find_in_parent_folders()` searches up the directory tree from the current `terragrunt.hcl` file and returns the 
relative path to the first `terragrunt.hcl` in a parent folder or exit with an error if no such file is found. This is
primarily useful in an `include` block to automatically find the path to a parent `terragrunt.hcl` file:

```hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

The function takes an optional `name` parameter that allows you to specify a different filename to search for:

```hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("some-other-file-name.hcl")
}
```

You can also pass an optional second `fallback` parameter which causes the function to return the fallback value
(instead of exiting with an error) if the file in the `name` parameter cannot be found:

```hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("some-other-file-name.tfvars", "fallback.tfvars")
}
```


#### path_relative_to_include

`path_relative_to_include()` returns the relative path between the current `terragrunt.hcl` file and the `path` 
specified in its `include` block. For example, consider the following folder structure:

```
├── terragrunt.hcl
└── prod
    └── mysql
        └── terragrunt.hcl
└── stage
    └── mysql
        └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Imagine `prod/mysql/terragrunt.hcl` and `stage/mysql/terragrunt.hcl` include all settings from the root
`terragrunt.hcl` file:

```hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

The root `terragrunt.hcl` can use the `path_relative_to_include()` in its `remote_state` configuration to ensure
each child stores its remote state at a different `key`:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "my-terraform-bucket"
    region = "us-east-1"
    key    = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

The resulting `key` will be `prod/mysql/terraform.tfstate` for the prod `mysql` module and
`stage/mysql/terraform.tfstate` for the stage `mysql` module.


#### path_relative_from_include

`path_relative_from_include()` returns the relative path between the `path` specified in its `include` block and the 
current `terragrunt.hcl` file (it is the counterpart of `path_relative_to_include()`). For example, consider the 
following folder structure:

```
├── sources
|  ├── mysql
|  |  └── *.tf
|  └── secrets
|     └── mysql
|         └── *.tf
└── terragrunt
  └── common.tfvars
  ├── mysql
  |  └── terragrunt.hcl
  ├── secrets
  |  └── mysql
  |     └── terragrunt.hcl
  └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Imagine `terragrunt/mysql/terragrunt.hcl` and `terragrunt/secrets/mysql/terragrunt.hcl` include all settings from the 
root `terragrunt.hcl` file:

```hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

The root `terragrunt.hcl` can use the `path_relative_from_include()` in combination with `path_relative_to_include()` 
in its `source` configuration to retrieve the relative terraform source code from the terragrunt configuration file:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "${path_relative_from_include()}/../sources//${path_relative_to_include()}"
}
```

The resulting `source` will be `../../sources//mysql` for `mysql` module and `../../../sources//secrets/mysql` for 
`secrets/mysql` module.

Another use case would be to add extra argument to include the `common.tfvars` file for all subdirectories:

```hcl
  terraform {
    extra_arguments "common_var" {
      commands = [
        "apply",
        "plan",
        "import",
        "push",
        "refresh"
      ]

      arguments = [
        "-var-file=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${path_relative_from_include()}/common.tfvars",
      ]
    }
  }
```

This allows proper retrieval of the `common.tfvars` from whatever the level of subdirectories we have.


#### get_env

`get_env(NAME, DEFAULT)` returns the value of the environment variable named `NAME` or `DEFAULT` if that environment
variable is not set. Example:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = get_env("BUCKET", "my-terraform-bucket")
  }
}
```

Note that [Terraform will read environment
variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/environment-variables.html#tf_var_name) that start with the
prefix `TF_VAR_`, so one way to share a variable named `foo` between Terraform and Terragrunt is to set its value
as the environment variable `TF_VAR_foo` and to read that value in using this `get_env()` built-in function.

#### get_terragrunt_dir

`get_terragrunt_dir()` returns the directory where the Terragrunt configuration file (by default `terragrunt.hcl`) lives.
This is useful when you need to use relative paths with [remote Terraform
configurations](#remote-terraform-configurations) and you want those paths relative to your Terragrunt configuration
file and not relative to the temporary directory where Terragrunt downloads the code.

For example, imagine you have the following file structure:

```
/terraform-code
├── common.tfvars
├── frontend-app
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Inside of `/terraform-code/frontend-app/terragrunt.hcl` you might try to write code that looks like this:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:foo/modules.git//frontend-app?ref=v0.0.3"

  extra_arguments "custom_vars" {
    commands = [
      "apply",
      "plan",
      "import",
      "push",
      "refresh"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-var-file=../common.tfvars" # Note: This relative path will NOT work correctly!
    ]
  }
}
```

Note how the `source` parameter is set, so Terragrunt will download the `frontend-app` code from the `modules` repo
into a temporary folder and run `terraform` in that temporary folder. Note also that there is an `extra_arguments`
block that is trying to allow the `frontend-app` to read some shared variables from a `common.tfvars` file.
Unfortunately, the relative path (`../common.tfvars`) won't work, as it will be relative to the temporary folder!
Moreover, you can't use an absolute path, or the code won't work on any of your teammates' computers.

To make the relative path work, you need to use `get_terragrunt_dir()` to combine the path with the folder where
the `terragrunt.hcl` file lives:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:foo/modules.git//frontend-app?ref=v0.0.3"

  extra_arguments "custom_vars" {
    commands = [
      "apply",
      "plan",
      "import",
      "push",
      "refresh"
    ]

    # With the get_terragrunt_dir() function, you can use relative paths!
    arguments = [
      "-var-file=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../common.tfvars"
    ]
  }
}
```

For the example above, this path will resolve to `/terraform-code/frontend-app/../common.tfvars`, which is exactly
what you want.


#### get_parent_terragrunt_dir

`get_parent_terragrunt_dir()` returns the absolute directory where the Terragrunt parent configuration file (by default 
`terragrunt.hcl`) lives. This is useful when you need to use relative paths with [remote Terraform 
configurations](#remote-terraform-configurations) and you want those paths relative to your parent Terragrunt 
configuration file and not relative to the temporary directory where Terragrunt downloads the code.

This function is very similar to [get_terragrunt_dir()](#get_terragrunt_dir) except it returns the root instead of the 
leaf of your terragrunt configuration folder.

```
/terraform-code
├── terragrunt.hcl
├── common.tfvars
├── app1
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── tests
│   ├── app2
│   |   └── terragrunt.hcl
│   └── app3
│       └── terragrunt.hcl
```

```hcl
terraform {
  extra_arguments "common_vars" {
    commands = [
      "apply",
      "plan",
      "import",
      "push",
      "refresh"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-var-file=${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/common.tfvars"
    ]
  }
}
```

The common.tfvars located in the terraform root folder will be included by all applications, whatever their relative location to the root.

#### get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars

`get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()` returns the list of terraform commands that accept `-var` and `-var-file` 
parameters. This function is used when defining [extra_arguments](#keep-your-cli-flags-dry).

```hcl
terraform {
  extra_arguments "common_var" {
    commands  = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()
    arguments = ["-var-file=${get_aws_account_id()}.tfvars"]
  }
}
```

#### get_terraform_commands_that_need_input

`get_terraform_commands_that_need_input()` returns the list of terraform commands that accept the `-input=(true or false)` 
parameter. This function is used when defining [extra_arguments](#keep-your-cli-flags-dry).

```hcl
terraform {
  # Force Terraform to not ask for input value if some variables are undefined.
  extra_arguments "disable_input" {
    commands  = get_terraform_commands_that_need_input()
    arguments = ["-input=false"]
  }
}
```

#### get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking

`get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking()` returns the list of terraform commands that accept the `-lock-timeout` 
parameter. This function is used when defining [extra_arguments](#keep-your-cli-flags-dry).

```hcl
terraform {
  # Force Terraform to keep trying to acquire a lock for up to 20 minutes if someone else already has the lock
  extra_arguments "retry_lock" {
    commands  = get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking()
    arguments = ["-lock-timeout=20m"]
  }
}
```

#### get_terraform_commands_that_need_parallelism

`get_terraform_commands_that_need_parallelism()` returns the list of terraform commands that accept the `-parallelism` 
parameter. This function is used when defining [extra_arguments](#keep-your-cli-flags-dry).

```hcl
terraform {
  # Force Terraform to run with reduced parallelism
  extra_arguments "parallelism" {
    commands  = get_terraform_commands_that_need_parallelism()
    arguments = ["-parallelism=5"]
  }
}
```

#### get_aws_account_id

`get_aws_account_id()` returns the AWS account id associated with the current set of credentials. Example:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "mycompany-${get_aws_account_id()}"
  }
}
```

This allows uniqueness of the storage bucket per AWS account (since bucket name must be globally unique).

It is also possible to configure variables specifically based on the account used:

```hcl
terraform {
  extra_arguments "common_var" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()
    arguments = ["-var-file=${get_aws_account_id()}.tfvars"]
  }
}
```

#### run_cmd

`run_cmd(command, arg1, arg2...)` runs a shell command and returns the stdout as the result of the interpolation. The 
command is executed at the same folder as the `terragrunt.hcl` file. This is useful whenever you want to dynamically 
fill in arbitrary information in your Terragrunt configuration. 

As an example, you could write a script that determines the bucket and DynamoDB table name based on the AWS account, 
instead of hardcoding the name of every account:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket         = run_cmd("./get_names.sh", "bucket")
    dynamodb_table = run_cmd("./get_names.sh", "dynamodb")
  }
}
```

If the command you are running has the potential to output sensitive values, you may wish to redact the output from
appearing in the terminal. To do so, use the special `--terragrunt-quiet` argument which must be passed as the first 
argument to `run_cmd()`:
```hcl
super_secret_value = run_cmd("--terragrunt-quiet", "./decrypt_secret.sh", "foo") 
```

**Note:** This will prevent terragrunt from displaying the output from the command in its output. 
However, the value could still be displayed in the Terraform output if Terraform does not treat it as a 
[sensitive value](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output).

### Before and After Hooks

_Before Hooks_ or _After Hooks_ are a feature of terragrunt that make it possible to define custom actions
that will be called either before or after execution of the `terraform` command.

Here's an example:

```hcl
terraform {
  before_hook "before_hook_1" {
    commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
    execute      = ["echo", "Foo"]
    run_on_error = true
  }

  before_hook "before_hook_2" {
    commands     = ["apply"]
    execute      = ["echo", "Bar"]
    run_on_error = false
  }

  before_hook "interpolation_hook_1" {
    commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
    execute      = ["echo", get_env("HOME", "HelloWorld")]
    run_on_error = false
  }

  after_hook "after_hook_1" {
    commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
    execute      = ["echo", "Baz"]
    run_on_error = true
  }

  after_hook "init_from_module" {
    commands = ["init-from-module"]
    execute  = ["cp", "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/foo.tf", "."]
  }
}
```

Hooks support the following arguments:

* `commands` (required): the `terraform` commands that will trigger the execution of the hook.
* `execute` (required): the shell command to execute. 
* `run_on_error` (optional): if set to true, this hook will run even if a previous hook hit an error, or in the case of
  "after" hooks, if the Terraform command hit an error. Default is false.
* `init_from_module` and `init`: This is not an argument, but a special name you can use for hooks that run during
  initialization. There are two stages of initialization: one is to download 
  [remote configurations](#keep-your-terraform-code-dry) using `go-getter`; the other is [Auto-Init](#auto-init), which 
  configures the backend and downloads provider plugins and modules. If you wish to execute a hook when Terragrunt is 
  using `go-getter` to download remote configurations, name the hook `init_from_module`. If you wish to execute a hook 
  when Terragrunt is using `terraform init` for Auto-Init, name the hook `init`.   




### Auto-Init

_Auto-Init_ is a feature of Terragrunt that makes it so that `terragrunt init` does not need to be called explicitly 
before other terragrunt commands.

When Auto-Init is enabled (the default), terragrunt will automatically call 
[`terraform init`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) during other commands (e.g. `terragrunt plan`)
 when terragrunt detects that:
 
* `terraform init` has never been called, or
* `source` needs to be downloaded, or
* the modules or remote state used by the module have changed since the previous call to `terraform init`.

As mentioned [above](#extra_arguments-for-init), `extra_arguments` can be configured to allow customization of the 
`terraform init` command.

Note that there might be cases where terragrunt does not properly detect that `terraform init` needs be called.
In this case, terraform would fail. Running `terragrunt init` again corrects this situation.

For some use cases, it might be desirable to disable Auto-Init. For example, if each user wants to specify a different 
`-plugin-dir` option to `terraform init` (and therefore it cannot be put in `extra_arguments`). To disable Auto-Init, 
use the `--terragrunt-no-auto-init` command line option or set the `TERRAGRUNT_AUTO_INIT` environment variable to 
`false`.

Disabling Auto-Init means that you _must_ explicitly call `terragrunt init` prior to any other terragrunt commands for 
a particular configuration. If Auto-Init is disabled, and terragrunt detects that `terraform init` needs to be called, 
then terragrunt will fail.

### Auto-Retry

_Auto-Retry_ is a feature of `terragrunt` that will automatically address situations where a `terraform` command needs 
to be re-run.

Terraform can fail with transient errors which can be addressed by simply retrying the command again. In the event 
`terragrunt` finds one of these errors, the command will be re-run again automatically.

**Example**

```
$ terragrunt apply
...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com...
Error installing provider "template": error fetching checksums: Get https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform-provider-template/1.0.0/terraform-provider-template_1.0.0_SHA256SUMS: net/http: TLS handshake timeout.
```

Terragrunt sees this error, and knows it is a transient error that can addressed by re-running the `apply` command.

`auto-retry` will try a maximum of three times to re-run the command, at which point it will deem the error as not 
transient, and accept the terraform failure. Retries will occur when the error is encountered, pausing for 5 seconds 
between retries.

Known errors that `auto-retry` will rerun, are maintained in the `TerragruntOptions.RetryableErrors` array. Future 
upgrades to `terragrunt` may include the ability to configure `auto-retry` by specifying additional error strings and 
configuring max retries and retry intervals the `terragrunt` config (PRs welcome!).

To disable `auto-retry`, use the `--terragrunt-no-auto-retry` command line option or set the `TERRAGRUNT_AUTO_RETRY` 
environment variable to `false`.


### CLI Options

Terragrunt forwards all arguments and options to Terraform. The only exceptions are `--version`, `terragrunt-info` and 
arguments that start with the prefix `--terragrunt-`. The currently available options are:

* `--terragrunt-config`: A custom path to the `terragrunt.hcl` file. May also be specified via the `TERRAGRUNT_CONFIG`
  environment variable. The default path is `terragrunt.hcl` in the current directory (see
  [Configuration](#configuration) for a slightly more nuanced explanation). This argument is not
  used with the `apply-all`, `destroy-all`, `output-all`, `validate-all`, and `plan-all` commands.

* `--terragrunt-tfpath`: A custom path to the Terraform binary. May also be specified via the `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH`
  environment variable. The default is `terraform` in a directory on your PATH.

* `--terragrunt-no-auto-init`: Don't automatically run `terraform init` when other commands are run (e.g. `terragrunt 
  apply`). Useful if you want to pass custom arguments to `terraform init` that are specific to a user or execution 
  environment, and therefore cannot be specified as `extra_arguments`. For example, `-plugin-dir`. You must run 
  `terragrunt init` yourself in this case if needed. `terragrunt` will fail if it detects that `init` is needed, but 
  auto init is disabled. See [Auto-Init](#auto-init)

* `--terragrunt-no-auto-retry`: Don't automatically retry commands which fail with transient errors.
  See [Auto-Retry](#auto-retry)

* `--terragrunt-non-interactive`: Don't show interactive user prompts. This will default the answer for all prompts to
  'yes'. Useful if you need to run Terragrunt in an automated setting (e.g. from a script). May also be specified with 
  the [TF_INPUT](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/environment-variables.html#tf_input) environment variable.

* `--terragrunt-working-dir`: Set the directory where Terragrunt should execute the `terraform` command. Default is the
  current working directory. Note that for the `apply-all`, `destroy-all`, `output-all`, `validate-all`, and `plan-all`
  commands, this parameter has a different meaning: Terragrunt will apply or destroy all the Terraform modules in the
  subfolders of the `terragrunt-working-dir`, running `terraform` in the root of each module it finds.

* `--terragrunt-download-dir`: The path where to download Terraform code when using [remote Terraform
  configurations](#keep-your-terraform-code-dry). May also be specified via the `TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD` environment
  variable. Default is `.terragrunt-cache` in the working directory. We recommend adding this folder to your `.gitignore`.

* `--terragrunt-source`: Download Terraform configurations from the specified source into a temporary folder, and run
  Terraform in that temporary folder. May also be specified via the `TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE` environment variable. The
  source should use the same syntax as the [Terraform module source](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html)
  parameter. If you specify this argument for the `apply-all`, `destroy-all`, `output-all`, `validate-all`, or `plan-all`
  commands, Terragrunt will assume this is the local file path for all of your Terraform modules, and for each module
  processed by the `xxx-all` command, Terragrunt will automatically append the path of `source` parameter in each
  module to the `--terragrunt-source` parameter you passed in.

* `--terragrunt-source-update`: Delete the contents of the temporary folder before downloading Terraform source code
  into it. Can also be enabled by setting the `TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE_UPDATE` environment variable to `true`.

* `--terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors`: `*-all` commands continue processing components even if a dependency fails

* `--terragrunt-iam-role`: Assume the specified IAM role ARN before running Terraform or AWS commands. May also be
  specified via the `TERRAGRUNT_IAM_ROLE` environment variable. This is a convenient way to use Terragrunt and
  Terraform with multiple AWS accounts.

* `--terragrunt-exclude-dir`: Unix-style glob of directories to exclude when running `*-all` commands. Modules under 
  these directories will be excluded during execution of the commands. If a relative path is specified, it should be 
  relative from `--terragrunt-working-dir`. Flag can be specified multiple times.

* `--terragrunt-include-dir`: Unix-style glob of directories to include when running `*-all` commands. Only modules 
  under these directories (and all dependent modules) will be included during execution of the commands. If a relative 
  path is specified, it should be relative from `--terragrunt-working-dir`. Flag can be specified multiple times.

* `--terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies`: Dont attempt to include any external dependencies when running `*-all` 
  commands

### Configuration

Terragrunt configuration is defined in a `terragrunt.hcl` file. This uses the same HCL syntax as Terraform itself.

Here's an example:

```hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependencies {
  paths = ["../vpc", "../mysql", "../redis"]
}
```

Terragrunt figures out the path to its config file according to the following rules:

 1. The value of the `--terragrunt-config` command-line option, if specified.
 1. The value of the `TERRAGRUNT_CONFIG` environment variable, if defined.
 1. A `terragrunt.hcl` file in the current working directory, if it exists.
 1. If none of these are found, exit with an error.


#### prevent_destroy

Terragrunt `prevent_destroy` boolean flag allows you to protect selected Terraform module. It will prevent `destroy`
or `destroy-all` command to actually destroy resources of the protected module. This is useful for modules you want
to carefully protect, such as a database, or a module that provides auth.

Example:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:foo/modules.git//app?ref=v0.0.3"
}

prevent_destroy = true
```

#### skip

The terragrunt `skip` boolean flag can be used to protect modules you don't want any changes to or just to skip modules
that don't define any infrastructure by themselves. When set to true, all terragrunt commands will skip the selected 
module.

Consider the following file structure:

```
root
├── terragrunt.hcl
├── prod
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── dev
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── qa
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

In some cases, the root level `terragrunt.hcl` file is solely used to DRY up your Terraform configuration by being
included in the other `terragrunt.hcl` files. In this case, you do not want the `xxx-all` commands to process the root
level `terragrunt.hcl` since it does not define any infrastructure by itself. To make the `xxx-all` commands skip the
root level `terragrunt.hcl` file, you can set `skip = true`:

```hcl
skip = true
```

The `skip` flag must be set explicitly in terragrunt modules that should be skipped. If you set `skip = true` in a
`terragrunt.hcl` file that is included by another `terragrunt.hcl` file, only the `terragrunt.hcl` file that explicitly
set `skip = true` will be skipped.


### Configuration parsing order

It is important to be aware of the terragrunt configuration parsing order when using features like [locals](#locals) and
[dependency outputs](#passing-outputs-between-modules), where you can reference attributes of other blocks in the config
in your `inputs`. For example, because `locals` are evaluated before `dependency` blocks, you can not bind outputs
from `dependency` into `locals`. On the other hand, for the same reason, you can use `locals` in the
`dependency` blocks.

Currently terragrunt parses the config in the following order:

1. `locals` block
1. `include` block
1. `dependencies` block
1. `dependency` blocks, including calling `terragrunt output` on the dependent modules to retrieve the outputs
1. Everything else
1. The config referenced by `include`
1. A merge operation between the config referenced by `include` and the current config.

Blocks that are parsed earlier in the process will be made available for use in the parsing of later blocks. Similarly,
you cannot use blocks that are parsed later earlier in the process (e.g you can't reference `dependency` in
`locals`, `include`, or `dependencies` blocks).

Note that the parsing order is slightly different when using the `-all` flavors of the command. In the `-all` flavors of
the command, Terragrunt parses the configuration twice. In the first pass, it follows the following parsing order:

1. `locals` block of all configurations in the tree
1. `include` block of all configurations in the tree
1. `dependency` blocks of all configurations in the tree, but does NOT retrieve the outputs
1. `terraform` block of all configurations in the tree
1. `dependencies` block of all configurations in the tree

The results of this pass are then used to build the dependency graph of the modules in the tree. Once the graph is
constructed, Terragrunt will loop through the modules and run the specified command. It will then revert to the single
configuration parsing order specified above for each module as it runs the command.

This allows Terragrunt to avoid resolving `dependency` on modules that haven't been applied yet when doing a
clean deployment from scratch with `apply-all`.


### Formatting terragrunt.hcl

You can rewrite `terragrunt.hcl` files to a canonical format using the `hclfmt` command built into `terragrunt`. Similar
to `terraform fmt`, this command applies a subset of [the Terraform language style
conventions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/style.html), along with other minor adjustments for
readability.

This command will recursively search for `terragrunt.hcl` files and format all of them under a given directory tree.
Consider the following file structure:

```
root
├── terragrunt.hcl
├── prod
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── dev
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── qa
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

If you run `terragrunt hclfmt` at the `root`, this will update:

- `root/terragrunt.hcl`
- `root/prod/terragrunt.hcl`
- `root/dev/terragrunt.hcl`
- `root/qa/terragrunt.hcl`

Additionally, there's a flag `--terragrunt-check`. It allows to validating if files are properly formatted. It does not
rewrite files and in case of invalid format, it will return an error with exit status 0.

#### terraform_binary

The terragrunt `terraform_binary` string option can be used to override the default terraform binary path (which is `terraform`).

The precedence is as follows: `--terragrunt-tfpath` command line option -> `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` env variable -> `terragrunt.hcl` in the module directory -> included `terragrunt.hcl`

#### terraform_version_constraint

The terragrunt `terraform_version_constraint` string overrides the default minimum supported version of terraform.
Terragrunt only officially supports the latest version of terraform, however in some cases an old terraform is needed.

For example:

```hcl
terraform_version_constraint = ">= 0.11"
```

### Clearing the Terragrunt cache

Terragrunt creates a `.terragrunt-cache` folder in the current working directory as its scratch directory. It downloads
your remote Terraform configurations into this folder, runs your Terraform commands in this folder, and any modules and
providers those commands download also get stored in this folder. You can safely delete this folder any time and
Terragrunt will recreate it as necessary.

If you need to clean up a lot of these folders (e.g., after `terragrunt apply-all`), you can use the following commands
on Mac and Linux:

Recursively find all the `.terragrunt-cache` folders that are children of the current folder:

```bash
find . -type d -name ".terragrunt-cache"
```

If you are ABSOLUTELY SURE you want to delete all the folders that come up in the previous command, you can recursively
delete all of them as follows:

```bash
find . -type d -name ".terragrunt-cache" -prune -exec rm -rf {} \;
```

Also consider setting the `TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD` environment variable if you wish to place the cache directories
somewhere else.




### Contributing

Terragrunt is an open source project, and contributions from the community are very welcome! Please check out the
[Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Developing Terragrunt](#developing-terragrunt) for instructions. 





### Developing Terragrunt

#### Running locally

To run Terragrunt locally, use the `go run` command:

```bash
go run main.go plan
```

#### Dependencies

* Terragrunt uses `dep`, a vendor package management tool for golang. See the dep repo for
  [installation instructions](https://github.com/golang/dep).

#### Running tests

**Note**: The tests in the `dynamodb` folder for Terragrunt run against a real AWS account and will add and remove
real data from DynamoDB. DO NOT hit `CTRL+C` while the tests are running, as this will prevent them from cleaning up
temporary tables and data in DynamoDB. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur.

Before running the tests, you must configure your [AWS credentials](#aws-credentials) and [AWS IAM policies](#aws-iam-policies).

To run all the tests:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

To run only the tests in a specific package, such as the package `remote`:

```bash
cd remote
go test -v
```

And to run a specific test, such as `TestToTerraformRemoteConfigArgsNoBackendConfigs` in package `remote`:

```bash
cd remote
go test -v -run TestToTerraformRemoteConfigArgsNoBackendConfigs
```


#### Debug logging

If you set the `TERRAGRUNT_DEBUG` environment variable to "true", the stack trace for any error will be printed to
stdout when you run the app.

Additionally, newer features introduced in v0.19.0 (such as `locals` and `dependency` blocks) can output more verbose
logging if you set the `TG_LOG` environment variable to `debug`.


#### Error handling

In this project, we try to ensure that:

1. Every error has a stacktrace. This makes debugging easier.
1. Every error generated by our own code (as opposed to errors from Go built-in functions or errors from 3rd party
   libraries) has a custom type. This makes error handling more precise, as we can decide to handle different types of
   errors differently.

To accomplish these two goals, we have created an `errors` package that has several helper methods, such as
`errors.WithStackTrace(err error)`, which wraps the given `error` in an Error object that contains a stacktrace. Under
the hood, the `errors` package is using the [go-errors](https://github.com/go-errors/errors) library, but this may
change in the future, so the rest of the code should not depend on `go-errors` directly.

Here is how the `errors` package should be used:

1. Any time you want to create your own error, create a custom type for it, and when instantiating that type, wrap it
   with a call to `errors.WithStackTrace`. That way, any time you call a method defined in the Terragrunt code, you
   know the error it returns already has a stacktrace and you don't have to wrap it yourself.
1. Any time you get back an error object from a function built into Go or a 3rd party library, immediately wrap it with
   `errors.WithStackTrace`. This gives us a stacktrace as close to the source as possible.
1. If you need to get back the underlying error, you can use the `errors.IsError` and `errors.Unwrap` functions.


#### Formatting

Every source file in this project should be formatted with `go fmt`. There are few helper scripts and targets in the
Makefile that can help with this (mostly taken from the [terraform repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/)):

1. `make fmtcheck`

   Checks to see if all source files are formatted. Exits 1 if there are unformatted files.
1. `make fmt`

    Formats all source files with `gofmt`.
1. `make install-pre-commit-hook`

    Installs a git pre-commit hook that will run all of the source files through `gofmt`.

To ensure that your changes get properly formatted, please install the git pre-commit hook with `make install-pre-commit-hook`.


#### Releasing new versions

To release a new version, just go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases) and
create a new release. The CircleCI job for this repo has been configured to:

1. Automatically detect new tags.
1. Build binaries for every OS using that tag as a version number.
1. Upload the binaries to the release in GitHub.

See `.circleci/config.yml` for details.
