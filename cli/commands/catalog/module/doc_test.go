# EKS K8s GitOps Module
This module deploys [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to an EKS cluster. Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. See the [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more details. This module supports deploying the Argo CD resources to Fargate in addition to EC2 Worker Nodes.


# Gruntwork GitOps "GruntOps"

GitOps is an operational framework that is built around DevOps best practices for a standardized approach to managing the lifecycle of Kubernetes based deployments. GitOps provides a unified approach to the deployment and management of container workloads, with Git being the single source of truth for the state of the container infrastructure. GitOps is a very developer-centric workflow that works best when adopted by individuals and teams that follow a git based development lifecycle. The core principles of GitOps have been at the center of Gruntwork from the beginning!


## Getting Started
To use this module, you will need to have a running EKS cluster prior to deploying this module. See the [Argo CD Example](/examples/eks-cluster-with-argocd/) for an example of how to deploy this module.

var testH1EksCloudwatchAgent = `
# EKS CloudWatch Agent Module

This Terraform Module installs and configures
[Amazon CloudWatch Agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/) on an EKS cluster, so that
each node runs the agent to collect more system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances and ship them to Amazon CloudWatch.
This extra metric data allows using [CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html)
for a single pane of glass for application, performance, host, control plane, data plane insights.

This module uses the [community helm chart](https://github.com/aws/eks-charts/tree/8b063ec/stable/aws-cloudwatch-metrics),
with a set of best practices inputs.

**This module is for setting up CloudWatch Agent for EKS clusters with worker nodes (self-managed or managed node groups) that
have support for [` + "`DaemonSets`" + `](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). CloudWatch Container
Insights is [not supported for EKS Fargate](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/920).**


## How does this work?

CloudWatch automatically collects metrics for many resources, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network.
Container Insights also provides diagnostic information, such as container restart failures,
to help you isolate issues and resolve them quickly.

## Overview

This service contains [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) code to deploy a production-grade ECS cluster on
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) using [Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).

This service launches an ECS cluster on top of an Auto Scaling Group that you manage. If you wish to launch an ECS
cluster on top of Fargate that is completely managed by AWS, refer to the
[ecs-fargate-cluster module](../ecs-fargate-cluster). Refer to the section
[EC2 vs Fargate Launch Types](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ecs/blob/master/core-concepts.md#ec2-vs-fargate-launch-types)
for more information on the differences between the two flavors.

= EKS AWS Auth Merger

This module contains a go CLI, docker container, and terraform module for deploying a Kubernetes controller for managing
mappings between AWS IAM roles and users to RBAC groups in Kubernetes. The official way to manage the mapping is to add
values in a single, central ` + "`ConfigMap`" + `. This module allows you to break up the central ` + "`ConfigMap`" + ` across multiple,
separate ` + "`ConfigMaps`" + ` each configuring a subset of the mappings you ultimately want to use, allowing you to update
entries in the ` + "`ConfigMap`" + ` in isolated modules (e.g., when you add a new IAM role in a separate module from the EKS
	cluster). The ` + "`aws-auth-merger`" + ` watches for ` + "`aws-auth`" + ` compatible ` + "`ConfigMaps`" + ` that can be merged to manage the
` + "`aws-auth`" + ` authentication ` + "`ConfigMap`" + ` for EKS.

== Features

* Break up the ` + "`aws-auth`" + ` Kubernetes ` + "`ConfigMap`" + ` across multiple objects.
* Automatically merge new ` + "`ConfigMaps`" + ` as they are added and removed.
* Track automatically generated ` + "`aws-auth`" + ` source ` + "`ConfigMaps`" + ` that are generated by EKS.
