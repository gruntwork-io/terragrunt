	// MAINTAINER'S NOTE: There are a few other commands that might not make sense, but we deliberately allow it for
	// certain use cases that are documented here:
	// - state          : Supporting `state` with run-all could be useful for a mass pull and push operation, which can
	//                    be done en masse with the use of relative pathing.
	// - login / logout : Supporting `login` with run-all could be useful when used in conjunction with mise and
	//                    multi-terraform version setups, where multiple terraform versions need to be configured.
	// - version        : Supporting `version` with run-all could be useful for sanity checking a multi-version setup.
