# Terragrunt Docs: Starlight Rewrite

This is the rewrite of the Terragrunt website using [Starlight](https://github.com/withastro/starlight), a documentation website framework for Astro. The goal is to provide a more user-friendly and accessible documentation for Terragrunt users.

## Development

To get started, install the requisite dependencies to run the project locally using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/):

```bash
mise install
```

Afterwards, you'll want to install the dependencies for the project:

```bash
bun i
```

You'll also need to install [d2](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) to build any diagrams:

You can now start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

## WIP

This is still a work in progress. Here are some of the tasks that need to be completed. For the list of tasks, see [TODO.md](TODO.md).
