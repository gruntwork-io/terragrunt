## Quick Install

The quickest way to install Terragrunt on Linux or macOS:

```bash
curl -sL https://docs.terragrunt.com/install | bash
```

:::tip[Script Options]
Run `curl -sL https://docs.terragrunt.com/install | bash -s -- --help` to see all options, or [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/main/docs-starlight/public/install).

## Download from releases page

1. Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases).
2. Download the archive for your operating system: e.g., if you're on a Mac, download `terragrunt_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`; if you're on Windows, download `terragrunt_windows_amd64.exe.zip`, etc.
3. Download `SHA256SUMS` and optionally `SHA256SUMS.gpgsig` for signature verification.
4. Verify the checksum and optionally the signature (see [Verifying the checksum](#verifying-the-checksum) below).
5. Extract the archive: e.g., `tar -xzf terragrunt_darwin_amd64.tar.gz` or unzip on Windows.
6. Add execute permissions to the binary (Linux/Mac): `chmod u+x terragrunt`.
7. Put the binary somewhere on your `PATH`: e.g., On Linux and Mac: `mv terragrunt /usr/local/bin/terragrunt`.

### Verifying the checksum

When you download the binary from the releases page, you can also use the checksum file to verify the integrity of the binary. This can be useful for ensuring that you have an intact binary and that it has not been tampered with.

To verify the integrity of the file, do the following:

1. Have the binary downloaded, and accessible.
2. Generate the SHA256 checksum of the binary.
3. Download the `SHA256SUMS` file from the releases page.
4. Find the expected checksum for the binary you downloaded.
5. If the checksums match, the binary is intact and has not been tampered with.
6. Optionally, verify the GPG signature:

```bash
# Import Gruntwork's public key (first time only)
curl -s https://gruntwork.io/.well-known/pgp-key.txt | gpg --import

# Verify signature
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.gpgsig SHA256SUMS
```

:::caution[Verify Key Fingerprint]
After importing the key, verify its fingerprint matches exactly:

```bash
gpg --fingerprint 577774ACA847CC49
```

Expected output:
```
pub   ed25519 2026-01-12 [SC]
      68C8 0F86 DF98 E710 C0F2  2E2E 5777 74AC A847 CC49
uid           [ unknown] Gruntwork (Code Signing Key) <security@gruntwork.io>
```
:::

7. Alternatively, verify with Cosign:

```bash
cosign verify-blob SHA256SUMS \
  --signature SHA256SUMS.sig \
  --certificate SHA256SUMS.pem \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt"
```

### Convenience Scripts

## Install via a package manager

Note that all the different package managers are third party. The third party Terragrunt packages may not be updated with the latest version, but are often close. Please check your version against the latest available on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases).
If you  want the latest version, the recommended installation option is to [download from the releases page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases).

* **Windows**: You can install Terragrunt on Windows using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

  ```bash
  choco install terragrunt
  ```

* **macOS**: You can install Terragrunt on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

  ```bash
  brew install terragrunt
  ```

* **Linux (Homebrew)**: Most Linux users can use [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux):

  ```bash
  brew install terragrunt
  ```
* **Linux (Pacman)**: Arch Linux users can use [pacman](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/terragrunt/):

  ```bash
  pacman -S terragrunt
  ```

* **Linux (Gentoo)**: Gentoo users can use [emerge](https://repology.org/project/terragrunt/versions):

  ```bash
  emerge -a app-admin/terragrunt-bin
  ```

* **FreeBSD**: You can install Terragrunt on FreeBSD using [Pkg](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?pkg(7)):

  ```bash
  pkg install terragrunt
  ```

## Install via tool manager

A best practice when using Terragrunt is to pin the version you are using to ensure that you, your colleagues and your CI/CD pipelines are all using the same version. This also allows you to easily upgrade to new versions and rollback to previous versions if needed.

You can use a tool manager to install and manage Terragrunt versions.

* **mise**: You can install Terragrunt using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev)

  <Code
    lang="bash"
    code={`mise install terragrunt ${version}`}
    frame="terminal"
  >
  </Code>

* **asdf**: You can install Terragrunt using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com)

  <Code
    lang="bash"
    code={`asdf plugin add terragrunt\nasdf install terragrunt ${version}`}
    frame="terminal"
  >
  </Code>

Both of these tools allow you to pin the version of Terragrunt you are using in a `.tool-versions` (and `.mise.toml` for mise) file in your project directory.

Colleagues and CI/CD pipelines can then install the associated tool manager, and run using the pinned version.

Note that the tools Terragrunt integrates with, such as OpenTofu and Terraform, can also be managed by these tool managers, so you can also pin the versions of those tools in the same file.

**Backend details:**

- **mise** uses [aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io/) as its default backend to install Terragrunt.
- **asdf** uses the asdf-terragrunt plugin, which is maintained by Gruntwork: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/asdf-terragrunt

## Building from source

If you'd like to build from source, you can use `go` to build Terragrunt yourself, and install it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt.git
cd terragrunt
# Feel free to checkout a particular tag, etc if you want here.
go install
```

## Enable tab completion

If you use either Bash or Zsh, you can enable tab completion for Terragrunt commands. To enable autocomplete, first ensure that a config file exists for your chosen shell.

For Bash shell.

```shell
touch ~/.bashrc
```

For Zsh shell.

```shell
touch ~/.zshrc
```

Then install the autocomplete package.

``` shell
terragrunt --install-autocomplete
```

Once the autocomplete support is installed, you will need to restart your shell.

## Gruntwork Pipelines

Gruntwork offers a commercial CI/CD solution for Terragrunt called [Pipelines](https://www.gruntwork.io/platform/pipelines). Pipelines is a fully managed CI/CD service that is designed to work seamlessly with Terragrunt. It provides an out of the box solution for running Terragrunt in CI/CD without the need to setup and maintain your own CI/CD infrastructure.

## Terragrunt GitHub Action

Terragrunt is also available as a GitHub Action.

Instructions on how to use it can be found at [https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-action](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-action).
