Terragrunt's "Run Queue" is the mechanism it uses to manage the run order and concurrency when running OpenTofu/Terraform commands across multiple Terragrunt [units](/docs/features/units). This is particularly relevant when using the [`run --all`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#all) or [`run --graph`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#graph) commands.

## How it Works: The Dependency Graph (DAG)

At its core, the Run Queue relies on a [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](/docs/getting-started/terminology#directed-acyclic-graph-dag) built from the dependencies defined between your Terragrunt units. These dependencies are typically established using [`dependency`](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks#dependency) or [`dependencies`](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks#dependencies) blocks in your `terragrunt.hcl` files.

Terragrunt analyzes these dependencies to determine the correct order of operations:

1.  **Discovery:** Terragrunt discovers configurations that might be relevant to a run based on the current working directory.
2.  **Constructing the Queue:** Based on the command being run, Terragrunt creates an ordered queue.
    *   For commands like `plan` or `apply`, dependencies are run *before* the units that depend on them.
    *   For commands like `destroy`, dependent units are run *before* their dependencies.
3.  **Runs:** Terragrunt dequeues the units in the queue and runs them, respecting the queue order. By default, it runs units concurrently up to a certain limit (controlled by the [`--parallelism`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#parallelism) flag), but it will always wait for a unit's dependencies (or dependents for destroys) to complete successfully before running that unit.

### Example DAG

Consider a setup where Unit B depends on Unit A, and Unit C depends on Unit B. Unit D has no dependencies.

```d2
direction: right

# Define the nodes
A: Unit A {
  shape: rectangle
}

B: Unit B {
  shape: rectangle
}

C: Unit C {
  shape: rectangle
}

D: Unit D {
  shape: rectangle
}

# Define the connections
A -> B: depends on
B -> C: depends on
```

-   **`run --all plan` Order:** Terragrunt would run C and D concurrently. Once C finishes, B would run. Once B finishes, A would run.
-   **`run --all destroy` Order:** Terragrunt would run A and D concurrently. Once A finishes, B would run. Once B finishes, C would run.

## Controlling the Queue

Several flags allow you to customize how Terragrunt builds and executes the run queue:

### Filtering Units

You can control which units are included or excluded from the queue:

-   [`--queue-include-dir`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-include-dir): Specify glob patterns for directories to *include*. Can be used multiple times.
-   [`--queue-exclude-dir`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-exclude-dir): Specify glob patterns for directories to *exclude*. Can be used multiple times. Note that dependencies of excluded units might be included unless they are also explicitly excluded.
-   [`--queue-excludes-file`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-excludes-file): Provide a file containing a list of directories to exclude.
-   [`--queue-strict-include`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-strict-include): Only include units matching `--queue-include-dir`. Excludes everything else by default.
-   [`--queue-include-external`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-include-external): Include external dependencies (those outside the main working directory or included directories).
-   [`--queue-exclude-external`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-exclude-external): Exclude external dependencies.
-   [`--queue-include-units-reading`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-include-units-reading): Include units that read a specific file (via [includes](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks#include) or HCL functions like [`mark_as_read`](/docs/reference/hcl/functions#mark_as_read)).

### Modifying Order and Error Handling

-   [`--queue-construct-as`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/list#queue-construct-as) (`--as`): Build the dependency queue *as if* running a particular command. Useful for performing dry-runs of [`run`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run) using discovery commands, like [`find`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/find) and [`list`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/list).
-   [`--queue-ignore-dag-order`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-ignore-dag-order): Execute units concurrently without respecting the dependency order. Useful for read-only commands like `validate` or `plan` across independent units, but **dangerous** for commands that modify state (`apply`, `destroy`).
-   [`--queue-ignore-errors`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-ignore-errors): Continue processing the queue even if some units fail. Useful for identifying all errors at once, but can lead to inconsistent state if used with `apply` or `destroy`.

## Important Considerations

<Aside type="caution">
When using `run --all plan` with units that have dependencies (e.g. via `dependency` or `dependencies` blocks), the command will fail if those dependencies have never been deployed. This is because Terragrunt cannot resolve dependency outputs without existing state.

To work around this issue, use [mock outputs in dependency blocks](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks/#dependency).
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
Do not set `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` when using `run --all` (unless using OpenTofu >= 1.10).

This can cause concurrent access issues with the provider cache. Instead, use Terragrunt's built-in [Provider Cache Server](/docs/features/provider-cache-server/).
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
When using `run --all` with `apply` or `destroy`, Terragrunt automatically adds the `-auto-approve` flag due to limitations with shared stdin making individual approvals impossible. Use [`--no-auto-approve`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#no-auto-approve) to override this, but be aware you might need alternative approval workflows.
