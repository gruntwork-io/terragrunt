This feature has been stabilized and is now enabled by default when using OpenTofu >= 1.10.

*Automatic Provider Cache Dir* is a feature of Terragrunt that automatically configures OpenTofu's native provider caching mechanism by setting the `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` environment variable. This enables efficient provider caching without the need to manually configure provider cache directories or use Terragrunt's provider cache server.

When using OpenTofu >= 1.10, Terragrunt will automatically configure OpenTofu to use a shared provider cache directory, which provides several benefits:

- **Improved performance**: Providers are downloaded once and reused across multiple configurations
- **Reduced bandwidth usage**: Eliminates redundant provider downloads
- **Better concurrency**: OpenTofu 1.10+ handles concurrent access to the provider cache safely
- **Simplified setup**: No need for manual provider cache configuration

## Requirements

The Automatic Provider Cache Dir feature has specific requirements:

- **OpenTofu version >= 1.10** is required
- **Only works with OpenTofu** (not Terraform)
- If requirements are not met, the experiment silently does nothing

## Usage

When using OpenTofu >= 1.10, this feature is enabled by default. No additional configuration is required:

```bash
terragrunt run --all apply
```

## How it Works

When enabled, Terragrunt automatically:

1. **Detects OpenTofu version** and ensures it meets the minimum requirement (>= 1.10)
2. **Sets up provider cache directory** using the default cache location or a custom path
3. **Configures TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR** environment variable for OpenTofu processes
4. **Ensures directory exists** with proper permissions

The default provider cache directory is located at:

- `$HOME/.terragrunt-cache/providers` on Unix systems
- `$HOME/Library/Caches/terragrunt/providers` on macOS
- `%LocalAppData%\terragrunt\providers` on Windows

## Customizing the Cache Directory

You can customize the provider cache directory using the `--provider-cache-dir` flag:

```bash
terragrunt apply --provider-cache-dir /custom/path/to/cache
```

Or with environment variables:

```bash
TG_PROVIDER_CACHE_DIR='/custom/path/to/cache' terragrunt apply
```

## Disabling Auto Provider Cache Dir

You can disable the feature for specific runs using the `--no-auto-provider-cache-dir` flag:

```bash
terragrunt run --all apply --no-auto-provider-cache-dir
```

This is particularly useful when:
- You want manual control over provider caching for specific environments
- Testing configurations without provider caching
- Using custom provider cache configurations

## Comparison with Provider Cache Server

Terragrunt also provides a [Provider Cache Server](/docs/features/provider-cache-server) feature. Here's when to use each:

**Use Auto Provider Cache Dir when:**

- Using OpenTofu 1.10+
- You want a simple, low-maintenance caching solution
- You prefer native OpenTofu caching mechanisms
- You need good concurrent access handling

**Use Provider Cache Server when:**

- Using older versions of OpenTofu/Terraform
- You need advanced caching features
- You want to share providers across different filesystems
- You need custom registry configurations

## Troubleshooting

If the feature doesn't seem to be working:

1. **Check OpenTofu version**: Ensure you're using OpenTofu 1.10 or later
2. **Check cache directory**: Ensure the cache directory is accessible and has proper permissions
3. **Review environment variables**: Verify `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` is not already set by another tool

You can enable debug logging to see more information:

```bash
terragrunt apply --log-level debug
```
