The `--filter` flag provides a sophisticated querying syntax for targeting specific [units](/docs/features/units) and [stacks](/docs/features/stacks) in Terragrunt commands. This unified approach offers powerful filtering capabilities using a flexible query language.

## Filter Syntax Overview

The filter syntax allows you to target units and stacks using several different approaches. Usage of the filter flag in a command can look like this:

```bash
$ terragrunt find --filter './prod/** | name=web'
prod/services/web
```

Where the result of `find` above might have been:

```bash
$ terragrunt find
prod/services/web
prod/services/api
prod/data/db
dev/services/web
dev/services/api
dev/data/db
```

For the following file tree:

<FileTree>
- prod
  - services
    - **web** \<-- Matched by the filter
      - terragrunt.hcl
    - api
      - terragrunt.hcl
  - data
    - db
      - terragrunt.hcl
- dev
  - services
    - web
      - terragrunt.hcl
    - api
      - terragrunt.hcl
  - data
    - db
      - terragrunt.hcl
</FileTree>

## Filter Expressions

There are several different types of filter expressions, and particular ways in which they can be combined to achieve different results. You can learn more about that below.

| Filter Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [Name](/docs/features/filter/name) | Match units and stacks by their name. |
| [Path](/docs/features/filter/path) | Match units and stacks by their file system path. |
| [Attribute](/docs/features/filter/attributes) | Match units and stacks by their configuration attributes. |
| [Negated](/docs/features/filter/combining#negated-expressions) | Exclude units and stacks using the `!` prefix. |
| [Intersection](/docs/features/filter/combining#intersection-expressions) | Use the `\|` operator to refine results. |
| [Union](/docs/features/filter/combining#union-expressions) | Combine filter results using multiple `--filter` flags. |
| [Graph](/docs/features/filter/graph) | Filter units based on their dependency relationships using graph traversal operators. |
| [Git](/docs/features/filter/git) | Filter units and stacks based on Git diffs using Git expressions. |
