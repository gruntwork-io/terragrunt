Match units and stacks by their name. This is the simplest form of filtering.

```bash
# Exact match
terragrunt find --filter app1

# Glob pattern
terragrunt find --filter 'app*'
```

<FileTree>
- apps
  - **app1** \<-- Matched by the first and second filter
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - **app2** \<-- Matched only by the second filter
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - other
    - terragrunt.hcl
</FileTree>

<Aside type="note">
Note that `app1` and `app2` were selected _within_ the `apps` directory. Filtering on names will match _any_ unit/stack that has a directory basename name matching a filter.
