Match units and stacks by their file system path.

```bash
# Relative paths
terragrunt find --filter './envs/prod/apps/app1'
terragrunt find --filter './envs/stage/**'

# Absolute paths
terragrunt find --filter '/absolute/path/to/envs/dev/apps/*'

# Wrapped paths (useful for explicitly indicating that this is a path expression)
terragrunt find --filter '{./envs/prod/apps/app2}'
```

<FileTree>
- envs
  - prod
    - apps
      - **app1** \<-- Matched by the first filter
        - terragrunt.hcl
      - **app2** \<-- Matched by the fourth filter
        - terragrunt.hcl
  - stage
    - apps
      - **app1** \<-- Matched by the second filter
        - terragrunt.hcl
      - **app2** \<-- Also matched by the second filter
        - terragrunt.hcl
  - dev
    - apps
      - **app1** \<-- Matched by the third filter
        - terragrunt.hcl
      - **app2** \<-- Also matched by the third filter
        - terragrunt.hcl
</FileTree>

<Aside type="note">
Note that globs used in path-based expressions will not recursively match nested directories unless you use the `**` wildcard.

(That's why `./envs/stage/**` is used above)

Glob patterns must use Unix forward slashes `/` to separate directories, even on Windows machines.
