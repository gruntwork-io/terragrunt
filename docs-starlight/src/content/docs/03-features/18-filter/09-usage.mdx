## Usage with Commands

The following commands all support the `--filter` flag using the same filtering syntax (note the section below on [special interactions](#special-interactions)):

- [find](/docs/reference/cli/commands/find)
- [list](/docs/reference/cli/commands/list)
- [run](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run)
- [hcl fmt](/docs/reference/cli/commands/hcl/fmt)
- [hcl validate](/docs/reference/cli/commands/hcl/validate)
- [stack run](/docs/reference/cli/commands/stack/run)
- [stack generate](/docs/reference/cli/commands/stack/generate)

This flag is intended to be a flexible way to target specific infrastructure that allows you to dry-run infrastructure targeting using discovery commands (like `find` and `list`) before running a command that actually affects infrastructure (like `run`).

## Comparison with Queue Control Flags

The `--filter` flag provides a unified alternative to multiple queue control flags.

| Legacy Flag | Filter Equivalent |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `--queue-include-dir=./path` | `--filter='./path'` |
| `--queue-exclude-dir=./path` | `--filter='!./path'` |
| `--queue-include-external` | `--filter='{./**}...'` |
| `--queue-include-units-reading=shared.hcl` | `--filter='reading=shared.hcl'` |

<Aside type="tip" title="Queue flag aliases">

If you are currently using those queue control flags, note that you are actually already using the equivalent filter expressions, as they are aliased internally.

You will generally have a better experience using the filter flag instead, as it provides a more powerful and flexible way to target infrastructure.

## Special Interactions

Certain commands have special interactions with the `--filter` flag that are worth noting.

### `hcl fmt`

Unlike when used for most commands, the `--filter` flag is used to filter on individual HCL files when used with the `hcl fmt`.

All other commands use `--filter` to filter on units and/or stacks (which are directories). As a result, only path-based filter expressions are supported. Attribute-based filters like `type=unit` or `name=my-app` are not applicable to file-level operations.

Example:

```bash
# Supported: Path-based expressions
terragrunt hcl fmt --filter './prod/**/*.hcl'

# Not supported: Attribute-based expressions
terragrunt hcl fmt --filter 'type=unit'  # This will not work
```

### `stack generate`

When using `--filter` with `stack generate`, filter expressions will only be recognized if they explicitly target stacks. This is to ensure that filters are not over-applied, preventing any stack generation from occurring.

```bash
# Supported: Only generate the stacks that match the filter, as we are explicitly indicating that we are targeting stacks.
terragrunt stack generate --filter 'name=prod | type=stack'

# Not supported: This filter will be ignored, as we are not explicitly indicating that we are targeting stacks.
terragrunt stack generate --filter 'name=prod'  # This will not work
```

The reason for this is that stack generation can also be done automatically as part of other commands, like `run`, and thus we need to make it clear that we're trying to control stack generation rather than run behavior.

```bash
# This will run any unit named 'vpc'
terragrunt run --all --filter 'vpc' -- plan

# This will run any unit named 'vpc', and prevent stack generation in any stack not named 'dev' (including any stacks named 'vpc')
terragrunt stack run --filter 'vpc' --filter 'name=dev | type=stack' -- apply
```
