Terragrunt configuration is defined in [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) files. This uses the same HCL syntax as OpenTofu/Terraform itself.

Here's an example:

```hcl
# terragrunt.hcl

include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
}

dependencies {
  paths = ["../vpc", "../mysql", "../redis"]
}
```

The core of Terragrunt configuration is that of the [unit](/docs/getting-started/terminology#unit), which is canonically defined using `terragrunt.hcl` files.

Terragrunt also supports [JSON-serialized HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/hcl2/json/spec.md) defined in `terragrunt.hcl.json` files. Where `terragrunt.hcl` is mentioned in documentation, you can always use `terragrunt.hcl.json` instead.

When determining the configuration for a unit, Terragrunt figures out the path to its configuration file according to the following rules:

1. The value of the `--config` command-line option, if specified.

2. The value of the `TG_CONFIG` environment variable, if defined.

3. A `terragrunt.hcl` file in the current working directory, if it exists.

4. A `terragrunt.hcl.json` file in the current working directory, if it exists.

5. If none of these are found, exit with an error.

Refer to the following pages for a complete reference of supported features in the terragrunt configuration file:

- [Blocks](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks)
- [Attributes](/docs/reference/hcl/attributes)
- [Functions](/docs/reference/hcl/functions)

## Configuration parsing order

It is important to be aware of the terragrunt configuration parsing order when using features like [locals](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks/#locals) and [dependency outputs](/docs/features/stacks#passing-outputs-between-units), where you can reference attributes of other blocks in the config in your `inputs`. For example, because `locals` are evaluated before `dependency` blocks, you cannot bind outputs from `dependency` into `locals`. On the other hand, for the same reason, you can use `locals` in the `dependency` blocks.

Currently terragrunt parses the config in the following order:

1. `include` block

2. `locals` block

3. Evaluation of values for `iam_role`, `iam_assume_role_duration`, `iam_assume_role_session_name`, and `iam_web_identity_token` attributes, if defined

4. `dependencies` block

5. `dependency` blocks, including calling `terragrunt output` on the dependent units to retrieve the outputs

6. Everything else

7. The config referenced by `include`

8. A merge operation between the config referenced by `include` and the current config.

Blocks that are parsed earlier in the process will be made available for use in the parsing of later blocks. Similarly, you cannot use blocks that are parsed later earlier in the process (e.g you can't reference `dependency` in `locals`, `include`, or `dependencies` blocks).

Note that the parsing order is slightly different when using the `--all` flag of the [`run`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run) command. When using the `--all` flag, Terragrunt parses the configuration twice. In the first pass, it follows the following parsing order:

1. `include` block of all configurations in the tree

2. `locals` block of all configurations in the tree

3. `dependency` blocks of all configurations in the tree, but does NOT retrieve the outputs

4. `terraform` block of all configurations in the tree

5. `dependencies` block of all configurations in the tree

The results of this pass are then used to build the dependency graph of the units in the stack. Once the graph is constructed, Terragrunt will loop through the units and run the specified command. It will then revert to the single configuration parsing order specified above for each unit as it runs the command.

This allows Terragrunt to avoid resolving `dependency` on units that haven't been applied yet when doing a clean deployment from scratch with `run --all apply`.

## Stacks

When multiple units, each with their own `terragrunt.hcl` file exist in child directories of a single parent directory, that parent directory becomes a [stack](/docs/getting-started/terminology#stack).

To make it easier to generate configurations like this, Terragrunt has special tooling in the form of `terragrunt.stack.hcl` files. `terragrunt.stack.hcl` files support all the same HCL functions as `terragrunt.hcl` files, however, they don't support any top-level attributes, and the configuration blocks they support are limited to the following:

- [unit](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks#unit)
- [stack](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks#stack)
- [locals](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks#locals)

These special configurations are used by the [stack generate command](/docs/reference/cli/commands/stack/generate) (and all the other `stack` prefixed commands) to generate units programmatically, on demand. The units they generate are valid unit configurations, and can be read and used as if they were manually authored.

## Included Configurations

When configurations are _included_ via the [include](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks#include) configuration block, Terragrunt expects configurations to be valid unit configurations.

Generally speaking, any HCL file found in a Terragrunt project that isn't named `terragrunt.hcl`, `terragrunt.stack.hcl` or `.terraform.lock.hcl` is expected to be partial unit configurations that will be included by a Terragrunt unit.

## Formatting HCL files

You can rewrite the HCL files to a canonical format using the `hclfmt` command built into `terragrunt`. Similar to `tofu fmt`, this command applies a subset of [the OpenTofu/Terraform language style conventions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/style.html), along with other minor adjustments for readability.

By default, this command will recursively search for hcl files and format all of them for a given stack. Consider the following file structure:

<FileTree>

- root
  - root.hcl
  - prod
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - dev
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - qa
    - terragrunt.hcl
    - services
      - services.hcl
      - service01
        - terragrunt.hcl

</FileTree>

If you run `terragrunt hclfmt` at the `root`, this will update:

- `root/root.hcl`

- `root/prod/terragrunt.hcl`

- `root/dev/terragrunt.hcl`

- `root/qa/terragrunt.hcl`

- `root/qa/services/services.hcl`

- `root/qa/services/service01/terragrunt.hcl`

You can set `--diff` option. `terragrunt hclfmt --diff` will output the diff in a unified format which can be redirected to your favourite diff tool. `diff` utility must be presented in PATH.

Additionally, there's a flag `--check`. `terragrunt hclfmt --check` will only verify if the files are correctly formatted **without rewriting** them. The command will return exit status 1 if any matching files are improperly formatted, or 0 if all matching `.hcl` files are correctly formatted.

You can exclude directories from the formatting process by using the `--hclfmt-exclude-dir` flag. For example, `terragrunt hclfmt --hclfmt-exclude-dir=qa/services`.

If you want to format a single file, you can use the `--hclfmt-file` flag. For example, `terragrunt hclfmt --hclfmt-file qa/services/services.hcl`.
