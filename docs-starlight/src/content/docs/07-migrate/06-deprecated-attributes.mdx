This guide explains how to migrate from the deprecated `skip` and `retryable_errors` attributes to their modern, more powerful replacements.

## Overview

Terragrunt has deprecated two attributes in favor of more flexible block-based configurations:

- **`skip`** → Use the **`exclude`** block instead
- **`retryable_errors`** → Use the **`errors`** block with **`retry`** sub-blocks instead

These new blocks provide more granular control and composability compared to the simple attributes they replace.

## Migrating from `skip` to `exclude`

### Why was `skip` deprecated?

The `skip` attribute was a simple boolean that would exclude a unit from the run queue. The new `exclude` block provides much more flexibility:

- Exclude the unit only for specific OpenTofu/Terraform commands (e.g., only `plan` but not `apply`)
- Use conditional logic to determine when to exclude the unit
- Combine multiple conditions
- Better integration with other Terragrunt features

### Basic Migration

**Before:**
```hcl
skip = true
```

**After:**
```hcl
exclude {
  if = true
  actions = ["all"]
}
```

### Conditional Skip

**Before:**
```hcl
skip = get_env("ENVIRONMENT") == "production"
```

**After:**
```hcl
exclude {
  if = get_env("ENVIRONMENT") == "production"
  actions = ["all"]
}
```

### Skip Specific Actions

The new `exclude` block allows you to exclude the unit only for specific OpenTofu/Terraform commands:

```hcl
exclude {
  if = get_env("SKIP_DESTROY") == "true"
  actions = ["destroy"]
}
```

This wasn't possible with the old `skip` attribute!

## Migrating from `retryable_errors` to `errors` Block

### Why was `retryable_errors` deprecated?

The `retryable_errors` attribute was a simple list of error patterns. The new `errors` block with `retry` sub-blocks provides:

- **Multiple retry configurations** with different patterns and settings
- **Named retry blocks** for better documentation
- **Per-retry configuration** of max attempts and sleep intervals
- **Composability** - combine multiple retry strategies
- **Better organization** for complex retry logic

### Basic Migration

**Before:**
```hcl
retryable_errors = [
  ".*Error: transient network issue.*",
  ".*Error: timeout.*"
]

retry_max_attempts     = 3
retry_sleep_interval_sec = 5
```

**After:**
```hcl
errors {
  retry "transient_errors" {
    retryable_errors = [
      ".*Error: transient network issue.*",
      ".*Error: timeout.*"
    ]
    max_attempts = 3
    sleep_interval_sec = 5
  }
}
```

### Using Default Retryable Errors

If you were using the `get_default_retryable_errors()` function:

**Before:**
```hcl
retryable_errors = concat(
  get_default_retryable_errors(),
  [".*custom error.*"]
)
```

**After:**
```hcl
errors {
  retry "default_errors" {
    retryable_errors = get_default_retryable_errors()
    max_attempts = 3
    sleep_interval_sec = 5
  }

  retry "custom_errors" {
    retryable_errors = [".*custom error.*"]
    max_attempts = 5
    sleep_interval_sec = 10
  }
}
```

Note: The `get_default_retryable_errors()` function still works and returns the default list for use within the `errors` block.

### Multiple Retry Strategies

The new `errors` block allows you to define different retry strategies for different types of errors:

```hcl
errors {
  # Quick retries for transient network issues
  retry "network_errors" {
    retryable_errors = [
      ".*connection reset.*",
      ".*timeout.*"
    ]
    max_attempts = 5
    sleep_interval_sec = 2
  }

  # Slower retries for rate limiting
  retry "rate_limit_errors" {
    retryable_errors = [
      ".*rate limit exceeded.*",
      ".*too many requests.*"
    ]
    max_attempts = 10
    sleep_interval_sec = 30
  }

  # Few retries for potential transient API issues
  retry "api_errors" {
    retryable_errors = [
      ".*internal server error.*"
    ]
    max_attempts = 3
    sleep_interval_sec = 15
  }
}
```

This level of granularity wasn't possible with the old `retryable_errors` attribute!

## Error Messages

If you try to use the deprecated attributes, Terragrunt will fail with an HCL parsing error:

**For `skip` attribute:**
```
Error: Unsupported argument

  on terragrunt.hcl line 2:
   2: skip = true

An argument named "skip" is not expected here.
```

**For `retryable_errors` attribute:**
```
Error: Unsupported argument

  on terragrunt.hcl line 4:
   4: retryable_errors = [".*Error: transient.*"]

An argument named "retryable_errors" is not expected here.
```

These errors indicate that the attributes have been completely removed from Terragrunt. Please refer to the migration examples below.

## How Retry Errors Are Collected

When you define multiple `retry` blocks within the `errors` block, Terragrunt automatically collects **all** the `retryable_errors` patterns from all retry blocks and uses them for error matching.

**Example:**
```hcl
errors {
  retry "network_errors" {
    retryable_errors = [".*timeout.*", ".*connection reset.*"]
    max_attempts = 5
    sleep_interval_sec = 2
  }

  retry "api_errors" {
    retryable_errors = [".*rate limit.*", ".*429.*"]
    max_attempts = 10
    sleep_interval_sec = 30
  }
}
```

In this example, Terragrunt will retry on any error matching:
- `.*timeout.*`
- `.*connection reset.*`
- `.*rate limit.*`
- `.*429.*`

Each retry block can have its own `max_attempts` and `sleep_interval_sec`,
allowing fine-grained control over retry behavior for different error types—for example,
one block can retry at 2-second intervals while another uses 30-second intervals.
