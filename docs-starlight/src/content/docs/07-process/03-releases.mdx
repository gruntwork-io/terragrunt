Terragrunt releases use [semantic versions (semver)](https://semver.org/).

Note that as of 2026/01/27, Terragrunt is still pre-1.0, so breaking changes may still be introduced in minor releases. We will try to minimize these changes as much as possible, but they may still happen.

Once 1.0 is released, Terragrunt backwards compatibility will be guaranteed for all minor releases (see [Terragrunt 1.0 Guarantees](/process/1-0-guarantees) for details on what constitutes a breaking change).

This documentation should be updated at that time to reflect the new policy. If it has not, please file a bug report.

### When to Cut a New Release

While Terragrunt is still pre-1.0, maintainers will cut a new release whenever a new feature is added or a bug is fixed. Maintainers will exercise their best judgment to determine when a new release is necessary, and bias towards cutting a new release as frequently as possible when in doubt.

### How to Create a New Release

To release a new version of Terragrunt, go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases) and cut a new pre-release off the `main` branch. Ensure that the new release uses the **Set as a pre-release** checkbox initially.

The GitHub Actions workflow for this repository has been configured to:

1. Automatically detect new tags.

2. Build assets for every OS using that tag as a version number (including binaries, archives, checksums, signature files, etc.).

3. Upload the assets to the release in GitHub.

See [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) for details.

Follow the GitHub Actions logs to ensure that the assets are built and uploaded correctly. Once the job is successful, go back to the release, give the release notes a final review, then uncheck the **Set as a pre-release** checkbox and check the **Set as the latest release** checkbox.

### Pre-releases

Occasionally, Terragrunt maintainers will cut a pre-release to get feedback on the UI/UX for a new feature or to give the community a chance to test it in the wild before making it generally available.

Alpha pre-releases are generally cut off a feature branch, in order to keep the `main` branch stable and releasable at all times.

Pre-releases are tagged with a pre-release name that looks like the following: `alpha2025022501`, etc. with the following information:

- Channel: e.g. `alpha` (indicating the stability of the release)

  The `alpha` channel has the following meaning in Terragrunt:

  - `alpha`: This release is recommended for testing in non-production environments only. It is intended for testing out new features with stakeholders external to Gruntwork before a general release.

  At the moment, this is really the only channel we need. In the future, we might adjust this to include more channels, such as `beta`, etc.

- Date: e.g. `20250225` (indicating the date the release was cut without dashes or slashes)
- Incremental number: e.g. `01` (indicating the number of pre-releases cut on that day)

This pre-release system is subject to change, and maintainers will update this documentation to reflect any changes.

The current plan for how maintainers are going to handle pre-releases after 1.0 is that:

1. Pre-releases for the `alpha` channel will continue to be cut from feature branches, and use the same naming convention as before.
2. Pre-releases for the `rc` channel will be cut from the `main` branch, and use a naming convention that looks like `v1.0.0-rc1`, which is incremented for each release candidate.

Release candidates in the `rc` channel will undergo more thorough testing, both automated and manual.
