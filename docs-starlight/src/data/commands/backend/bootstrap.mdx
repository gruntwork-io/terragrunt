## Provision remote_state

Using this command bootstraps the resources described in your [`remote_state` block](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks/#remote_state). 

If unavailable, Terragrunt will provision them. If they are present, but configured in a way that differs from `remote_state` configuration, Terragrunt will attempt to update them when it is safe to do so.

For example, if you have the following `remote_state` block:

```hcl
# terragrunt.hcl

remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket  = "mybucket"
    key     = "path/to/my/key"
    region  = "us-east-1"
    encrypt = true

    dynamodb_table = "tf-lock"

    accesslogging_bucket_name = "mybucket-logs"
  }
}
```

Then run the following:

```bash
terragrunt backend bootstrap
```

You'll ensure the availability of:

- An S3 bucket named `mybucket` in the `us-east-1` region with the following enabled:
  - Server Side Encryption (SSE)
  - Versioning
  - TLS Enforcement
- A DynamoDB table named `tf-lock` in the `us-east-1` region with SSE.
- An S3 bucket named `mybucket-logs` configured as the access log destination for the `mybucket` bucket.
