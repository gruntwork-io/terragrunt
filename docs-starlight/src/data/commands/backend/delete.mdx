## Delete State

Using this command deletes the backend state file for the current Terragrunt unit.

For example, given the following `remote_state` block:

```hcl
# terragrunt.hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket  = "mybucket"
    key     = "path/to/my/key"
    region  = "us-east-1"
    encrypt = true

    dynamodb_table = "tf-lock"

    accesslogging_bucket_name = "mybucket-logs"
  }
}
```

Running `terragrunt backend delete` will delete the backend state file located at `path/to/my/key` in the `mybucket` bucket.
