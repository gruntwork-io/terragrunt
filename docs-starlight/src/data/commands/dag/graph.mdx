description: Graph the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in DOT language.
usage: |
  Print a visual representation of the Terragrunt dependency graph in DOT language format.
  This command analyzes your Terragrunt configuration and outputs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) showing the relationships and dependencies between your Terraform modules.

  **Note:** This command is an alias for `list --format=dot`. Both commands produce identical output.
examples:
  - description: Graph all dependencies in the graph as a DotViz graph.
    code: |
      $ terragrunt dag graph
      digraph {
        "alb" ;
        "ecs" ;
        "ecs" -> "alb";
      }
  - description: Graph all dependencies in visual diagram.
    code: |
      $ terragrunt dag graph  | dot -Tpng > graph.png

<Aside type="note" title="Alias for list --format=dot">

The `dag graph` command is an alias for `list --format=dot --dependencies --external`. Both commands produce identical DOT format output:

```bash
terragrunt dag graph
# Equivalent to:
terragrunt list --format=dot --dependencies --external
```

For more information about the DOT format and its usage, see the [list command documentation](/docs/reference/cli/commands/list#dot-format).
