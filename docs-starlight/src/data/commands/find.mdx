description: Find relevant Terragrunt configurations.
usage: |
  The `find` command helps you discover Terragrunt configurations in your codebase.

  It recursively searches for `terragrunt.hcl` and `terragrunt.stack.hcl` files and displays them in formatted output.

## Color Output

When used without any flags, all units and stacks discovered in the current working directory are displayed in colorful text format.

<Aside type="note" title="Color Coding">

Discovered configurations are color coded to help you identify them at a glance:

- <Badge text="Units" style={{ backgroundColor: '#1B46DD', color: '#FFFFFF' }} /> are displayed in blue
- <Badge text="Stacks" style={{ backgroundColor: '#2E8B57', color: '#FFFFFF' }} /> are displayed in green

</Aside>

## Output Formats

The `find` command supports two output formats:

### Text Format (Default)

The default text format displays each configuration on a new line, with color coding for different types.

### JSON Format

You can output the results in JSON format using either:

```bash
terragrunt find --format=json
```

or the shorter alias:

```bash
terragrunt find --json
```

The JSON output includes additional metadata about each configuration, such as its type (unit or stack) and path.

## Sorting

The `find` command supports two sorting modes:

- `alpha` (default): Sort configurations alphabetically by path
- `dag`: Sort configurations based on their dependencies, ensuring dependencies are listed before their dependents

When using DAG sorting, configurations with no dependencies appear first, followed by configurations that depend on them:

```bash
terragrunt find --sort=dag
unitA           # no dependencies
unitB           # no dependencies
unitC           # depends on unitA
unitD           # depends on unitA and unitB
```

If multiple configurations share common dependencies, they will be sorted in lexical order.

## Dependencies

You can include dependency information in the output using the `--dependencies` flag. When enabled, the JSON output will include the dependency relationships between configurations:

```bash
terragrunt find --dependencies --format=json
[
  {
    "type": "unit",
    "path": "unitA",
    "dependencies": []
  },
  {
    "type": "unit",
    "path": "unitB",
    "dependencies": ["../unitA", "../../external/unitC"]
  }
]
```

By default, external dependencies (those outside the working directory) are not part of the overall results (although, they will be mentioned in the dependency section of the JSON output). Use the `--external` flag to include them as top-level results:

```bash
terragrunt find --dependencies --external --format=json
[
  {
    "type": "unit",
    "path": "internal/unitA",
    "dependencies": []
  },
  {
    "type": "unit",
    "path": "internal/unitB",
    "dependencies": ["../unitA", "../../external/unitC"]
  },
  {
    "type": "unit",
    "path": "external/unitC",
    "dependencies": []
  }
]
```

## Disabling Color Output

You can disable color output by using the global `--no-color` flag:

```bash
terragrunt find --no-color
```

When stdout is redirected, color output is disabled automatically to prevent undesired interference with other tools.

## Working Directory

You can change the working directory for `find` by using the global `--working-dir` flag:

```bash
terragrunt find --working-dir=/path/to/working/dir
```
