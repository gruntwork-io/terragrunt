description: Find relevant Terragrunt configurations.
usage: |
  The `find` command helps you discover Terragrunt configurations in your codebase.

  It recursively searches for `terragrunt.hcl` and `terragrunt.stack.hcl` files and displays them in formatted output.
experiment:
  control: cli-redesign
  name: CLI Redesign
examples:
  - description: |
      Find all configurations (units and stacks) in the current directory.
    code: |
      terragrunt find
  - description: |
      Find all configurations in a different directory.
    code: |
      terragrunt find --working-dir /path/to/working/dir
  - description: |
      Disable color output.
    code: |
      terragrunt find --no-color
  - description: |
      Find all configurations in the current directory and emit them as a JSON string.
    code: |
      terragrunt find --format 'json'
  - description: |
      Find all configurations and output them in JSON format (alias for --format=json).
    code: |
      terragrunt find --json
  # - description: |
  #     Find all units and sort them in the order they would be run in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

## Color Output

When used without any flags, all units and stacks discovered in the current working directory are displayed in colorful text format.

<Aside type="note" title="Color Coding">

Discovered configurations are color coded to help you identify them at a glance:

- <Badge text="Units" style={{ backgroundColor: '#1B46DD', color: '#FFFFFF' }} /> are displayed in blue
- <Badge text="Stacks" style={{ backgroundColor: '#2E8B57', color: '#FFFFFF' }} /> are displayed in green

</Aside>

## Output Formats

The `find` command supports two output formats:

### Text Format (Default)

The default text format displays each configuration on a new line, with color coding for different types.

### JSON Format

You can output the results in JSON format using either:

```bash
terragrunt find --format json
```

or the shorter alias:

```bash
terragrunt find --json
```

The JSON output includes additional metadata about each configuration, such as its type (unit or stack) and path.

## Disabling Color Output

You can disable color output by using the global `--no-color` flag:

```bash
terragrunt find --no-color
```

When stdout is redirected, color output is disabled automatically to prevent undesired interference with other tools.

## Working Directory

You can change the working directory for `find` by using the global `--working-dir` flag:

```bash
terragrunt find --working-dir /path/to/working/dir
```
