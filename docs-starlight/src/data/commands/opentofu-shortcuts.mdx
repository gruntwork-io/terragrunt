description: Use Terragrunt as a drop-in replacement for OpenTofu/Terraform commands.
usage: |
  Terragrunt is an orchestration tool for OpenTofu/Terraform, so with a couple exceptions, you can generally use it as a drop-in replacement for OpenTofu/Terraform.

  Terragrunt has a shortcut for most OpenTofu commands. You can usually just replace `tofu` or `terraform` with `terragrunt` and it will do what you expect.
examples:
  - description: |
      Run the apply command.
    code: |
      terragrunt apply
  - description: |
      Run the plan command.
    code: |
      terragrunt plan
  - description: |
      Run the output command.
    code: |
      terragrunt output
