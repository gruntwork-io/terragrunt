Render the Terragrunt configuration in the current working directory, with as much work done as possible beforehand (that is, with all includes merged, dependencies resolved/interpolated, function calls executed, etc).

The only supported format at the moment is JSON, but support for HCL will be added in a future version.

Example:

The following `terragrunt.hcl`:

```hcl
locals {
  aws_region = "us-east-1"
}

inputs = {
  aws_region = local.aws_region
}
```

Renders to the following JSON:

```bash
$ terragrunt render --format json
{
  "locals": { "aws_region": "us-east-1" },
  "inputs": { "aws_region": "us-east-1" }
  // NOTE: other attributes are omitted for brevity
}
```

You can also use the `--write` flag to write the rendered configuration to a canonically named file in the same working directory as the `terragrunt.hcl` file.

Example:

```bash
# Note the use of the `--json` shortcut flag. The `--write` flag also has a shorter alias of `-w`.
terragrunt render --json --write
```

This will write the rendered configuration to `terragrunt.rendered.json` in the current working directory.

This can be useful when rendering many configurations in a given directory, and you want to keep the rendered configurations in the same directory as the original configurations, without leveraging external tools or scripts.
