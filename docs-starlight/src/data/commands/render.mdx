Render the Terragrunt configuration in the current working directory, with as much work done as possible beforehand (that is, with all includes merged, dependencies resolved/interpolated, function calls executed, etc).

The only supported format at the moment is JSON, but support for HCL will be added in a future version.

Example:

The following `terragrunt.hcl`:

```hcl
locals {
  aws_region = "us-east-1"
}

inputs = {
  aws_region = local.aws_region
}
```

Renders to the following JSON:

```bash
$ terragrunt render --format json
{
  "locals": { "aws_region": "us-east-1" },
  "inputs": { "aws_region": "us-east-1" }
  // NOTE: other attributes are omitted for brevity
}
```

You can also use the `--write` flag to write the rendered configuration to a canonically named file in the same working directory as the `terragrunt.hcl` file.

Example:

```bash
# Note the use of the `--json` shortcut flag.
terragrunt render --json --write
```

This will write the rendered configuration to `terragrunt.rendered.json` in the current working directory.

This can be useful when rendering many configurations in a given directory, and you want to keep the rendered configurations in the same directory as the original configurations, without leveraging external tools or scripts.

This is also useful when combined with the `--all` flag, which will render all configurations discovered from the current working directory.

```bash
# Note the use of the `-w` alias for the `--write` flag.
terragrunt render --all --json -w
```

This will render all configurations discovered from the current working directory and write the rendered configurations to `terragrunt.rendered.json` files adjacent to the configurations they are derived from.
