## Generating a stack

```hcl
# terragrunt.stack.hcl

unit "mother" {
	source = "units/chicken"
	path   = "mother"
}

unit "father" {
	source = "./units/chicken"
	path   = "father"
}

unit "chick_1" {
	source = "./units/chick"
	path   = "chicks/chick-1"
}

unit "chick_2" {
	source = "units/chick"
	path   = "chicks/chick-2"
}
```

Running the following:

```bash
terragrunt stack generate
```

Generates the following stack:

<FileTree>

- terragrunt.stack.hcl
- .terragrunt-stack
  - mother
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - father
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - chicks
    - chick-1
      - terragrunt.hcl
    - chick-2
      - terragrunt.hcl
