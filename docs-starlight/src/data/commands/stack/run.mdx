The `stack run *` command allows users to execute IaC commands across all units defined in a `terragrunt.stack.hcl` file.
This feature facilitates efficient orchestration of operations on multiple units, simplifying workflows for managing complex infrastructure stacks.

## Automatic stack generation

Before executing the specified command, the `terragrunt stack run *` command will automatically generate the stack by creating
the `.terragrunt-stack` directory using the `terragrunt.stack.hcl` configuration file.
This ensures that all units are up-to-date before running the requested operation.
