name: all
description: Run the specified OpenTofu/Terraform command on the stack of units in the current directory.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_ALL

When this flag is set, Terragrunt will run the specified OpenTofu/Terraform command against all units in the current stack. This is useful when you want to apply changes across multiple units at once.

For example:

```bash
terragrunt run --all plan
```

This will run the `plan` command against all units in the current stack.

To learn more about how to use this flag, see the [Stacks](/docs/features/stacks/#the-run---all-command) feature documentation.
