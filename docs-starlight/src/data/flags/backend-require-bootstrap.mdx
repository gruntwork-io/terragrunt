  When this flag is set, Terragrunt will throw an error if remote state needs to be created via the `backend bootstrap` command.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_BACKEND_REQUIRE_BOOTSTRAP
---

This flag provides a safety mechanism when working with remote state backends.

This is particularly useful in production environments where you want to ensure that:

1. All infrastructure for storing state is properly bootstrapped before Terragrunt runs any OpenTofu/Terraform commands.
2. Prevent accidental creation of state buckets in scenarios where they should already exist.

Without this flag, Terragrunt will attempt to create the remote state bucket automatically if it doesn't exist (though this will change in the future).
