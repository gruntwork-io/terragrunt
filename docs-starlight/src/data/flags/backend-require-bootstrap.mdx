description: When this flag is set Terragrunt will fail if the remote state bucket needs to be created.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_BACKEND_REQUIRE_BOOTSTRAP

This flag provides a safety mechanism when working with remote state backends. When enabled, Terragrunt will fail with an error if it detects that the remote state bucket does not exist and would need to be created.

This is particularly useful in production environments where you want to ensure that:

1. All infrastructure for storing state is properly bootstrapped before Terragrunt runs any OpenTofu/Terraform commands.
2. Prevent accidental creation of state buckets in scenarios where they should already exist.

Without this flag, Terragrunt will attempt to create the remote state bucket automatically if it doesn't exist (though this will change in the future).
