When enabled, Terragrunt will disable hooks when processing boilerplate templates during catalog operations.

This is useful for security reasons when you want to prevent templates from executing arbitrary hooks on your system.

<Aside type="caution">
Do not use catalog/scaffold to scaffold untrusted templates. IaC configurations are inherently powerful, as they
can run arbitrary code on your system, so make sure to only use trusted templates you have reviewed and approved.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
Note that you will otherwise be prompted to confirm the execution of each hook unless you are running in [non-interactive mode](/docs/reference/cli/global-flags/#non-interactive).
</Aside>

Examples:

```bash
terragrunt catalog --no-hooks
```
