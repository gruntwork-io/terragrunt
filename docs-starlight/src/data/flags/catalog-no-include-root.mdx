env:

When enabled, Terragrunt will not automatically include the root configuration file in generated `terragrunt.hcl` files during scaffolding operations in the catalog.

This is useful when you want more control over which configurations are included in newly scaffolded modules.

Examples:

```bash
terragrunt catalog --no-include-root
```
