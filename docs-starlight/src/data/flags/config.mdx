name: config
description: The path to the Terragrunt config file. Default is terragrunt.hcl.
type: string
env:
  - TG_CONFIG

This flag allows you to specify a custom path to your Terragrunt configuration file. By default, Terragrunt looks for a file named `terragrunt.hcl` in the current directory.

This is useful when you:
- Have multiple Terragrunt configurations in the same directory.
- Want to use a different naming convention for your configuration files.
- Need to test alternative configurations without modifying the default file.

Example usage:

```bash
terragrunt run plan --config custom-config.hcl
```
