This flag modifies how Terragrunt retrieves output values from dependent units. When enabled, Terragrunt will read the outputs directly from the state file instead of running `terraform output` or `tofu output`.

The main benefit this flag provides is performance. Reading directly from state is typically faster than executing the OpenTofu/Terraform binary to get the same outputs.

The limitation of this approach is that it is only supported by the S3 backend, and OpenTofu/Terraform may change the schema of the state file in the future, breaking this functionality.

<Aside type="caution">
This is an experimental feature, use with caution.

There is no guarantee that OpenTofu/Terraform will maintain the existing schema of their state files, so there is also no guarantee that the flag will work as expected in future versions of OpenTofu/Terraform. Also, note that the only backend that supports this feature is the AWS S3 backend.

Direct output fetching is a performance optimization. For more details on performance optimizations, their tradeoffs, and other performance tips, read the dedicated [Performance documentation](/docs/troubleshooting/performance).
