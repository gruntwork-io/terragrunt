This flag modifies how Terragrunt retrieves output values from dependent units. When enabled, Terragrunt will read the outputs directly from the state file instead of running `terraform output` or `tofu output`.

The main benefit this flag provides is performance. Reading directly from state is typically faster than executing the OpenTofu/Terraform binary to get the same outputs.

The limitation of this approach is that it is only supported by the S3 backend, and OpenTofu/Terraform may change the schema of the state file in the future, breaking this functionality.

<Aside type="caution">
This is an experimental feature. When enabled, Terragrunt will fetch dependency outputs directly from the state file instead of using `tofu output`.

Currently, only the S3 backend is supported. Use with caution in production environments, as this feature is experimental and may change in the future.
