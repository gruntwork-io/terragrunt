import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When enabled, Terragrunt will verify if there are dependent units that would be affected by destroying the current unit and show a warning with the list of dependent modules.

<Aside type="tip">
Enabling dependency checks during destroy operations helps prevent accidental destruction of infrastructure that other units depend on.
