  When this flag is set, Terragrunt will not update the remote state resources.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_DISABLE_BUCKET_UPDATE
---

When enabled, Terragrunt will throw an error if it detects that remote state resources need to be updated.

This is useful in scenarios where:
- You want to ensure state bucket configurations remain unchanged during operations
- You have separate processes for managing state bucket configurations

The flag acts as a safety mechanism to prevent unintended modifications to your state storage infrastructure.
