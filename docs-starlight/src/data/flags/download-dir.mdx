Specifies a custom directory where Terragrunt will download and cache OpenTofu/Terraform modules.

By default, modules are downloaded to `.terragrunt-cache` in the working directory.

This flag is not recommended as a mechanism for sharing providers between units. Instead, use the [Provider Cache Server](/docs/features/provider-cache-server) feature.
