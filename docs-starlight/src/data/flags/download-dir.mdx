import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Specifies a custom directory where Terragrunt will download and cache OpenTofu/Terraform modules.

By default, modules are downloaded to `.terragrunt-cache` in the working directory.

<Aside type="note">
The download directory (`.terragrunt-cache` by default) can grow significantly over time with multiple versions of modules.

Remember to add this directory to your `.gitignore` file and consider periodic cleanup of old cached content.
