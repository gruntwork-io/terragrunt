description: Cache path for Terragrunt engine files.
type: string
env:
  - TG_ENGINE_CACHE_PATH
---

Specifies the directory where Terragrunt will store its engine cache files. The engine cache helps improve performance by storing compiled configurations and other internal data.

When not specified, Terragrunt will use a default location in the system's temporary directory.

You must also set the [`experimental-engine`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#experimental-engine) flag to enable engine usage.
