Controls the verbosity of logs from the Terragrunt engine. This is separate from the main Terragrunt logging and specifically affects engine-related operations like configuration parsing and dependency resolution.

By default, the engine log level is set to that of the main Terragrunt logging level.

You must also set the [`experimental-engine`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#experimental-engine) flag to enable engine usage.
