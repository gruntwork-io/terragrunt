type: bool
env:
  - TG_ENGINE_SKIP_CHECK

When enabled, Terragrunt will skip the checksum validation of engine files.

This can be useful during development or testing, and is currently the only way to use self-developed engines.

Terragrunt currently only has support for verifying the signatures of official engines, though this will change in the future.

In the meantime, you are encouraged to download engines from a trusted source, verify the integrity of the engine manually, and then reference the local path to the engine in your Terragrunt configuration.

You must also set the [`experimental-engine`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#experimental-engine) flag to use engines.
