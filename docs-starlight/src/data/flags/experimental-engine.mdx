Enables usage of [Terragrunt IaC engines](/docs/features/engine).

IaC engines are still experimental, as the API is unstable and may change in future minor versions of Terragrunt.

If you are using a remote custom engine, you must also set the [`engine-skip-check`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#engine-skip-check) flag to skip the signature check for the engine.
