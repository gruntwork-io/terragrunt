type: bool
env:
  - TG_EXPERIMENTAL_ENGINE
---

Enables the `iac-engine` experiment to use [Terragrunt IaC engines](/docs/features/engine).

This flag is equivalent to using `--experiment iac-engine`. You can also enable this experiment using the environment variable `TG_EXPERIMENT=iac-engine`.

IaC engines are still experimental, as the API is unstable and may change in future minor versions of Terragrunt.

If you are using a remote custom engine, you must also set the [`engine-skip-check`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#engine-skip-check) flag to skip the signature check for the engine.
