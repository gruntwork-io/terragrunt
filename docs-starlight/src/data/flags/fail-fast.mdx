When enabled, Terragrunt will fail the entire run as soon as any unit fails. If any unit encounters an error during execution, all remaining units will be skipped and the run will exit with a failure status immediately.

This is useful for enforcing strict failure handling in CI/CD pipelines or when you want to stop processing on the first error.

<Aside type="warning">
Using `--fail-fast` will stop all further processing as soon as a failure is detected. This can be helpful for fast feedback, but may prevent you from seeing all errors in a single run.
