When enabled, the output will include information about dependencies between configurations. This is particularly useful when combined with JSON output format to understand the dependency relationships in your codebase.

Example:

```bash
terragrunt find --dependencies --format json
[
  {
    "type": "unit",
    "path": "unitA",
    "dependencies": []
  },
  {
    "type": "unit",
    "path": "unitB",
    "dependencies": ["../unitA"]
  }
]
```
