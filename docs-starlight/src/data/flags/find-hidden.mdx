<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecated">
This flag is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Terragrunt. Hidden directories are now included by default, making this flag unnecessary.

Use [`--no-hidden`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/find#no-hidden) to exclude hidden directories from the results.
