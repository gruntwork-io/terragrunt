By default, Terragrunt includes hidden directories (those starting with a dot) in the find results. Use this flag to exclude them.

Example:

```bash
# Default: includes hidden directories
$ terragrunt find
.hide/unit
stack
unit

# With --no-hidden: excludes hidden directories
$ terragrunt find --no-hidden
stack
unit
```
