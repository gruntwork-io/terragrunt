When enabled, JSON output will include a list of files that were read during the parsing of each component. This is useful for understanding configuration dependencies and tracking which shared files are consumed by your Terragrunt configurations.

```bash
$ terragrunt find --reading --format=json | jq
[
  {
    "type": "unit",
    "path": "app",
    "reading": [
      "shared.hcl",
      "shared.tfvars",
      "common/variables.hcl"
    ]
  }
]
```

The `reading` field includes files read by Terragrunt helper functions such as:
- `read_terragrunt_config()` - Reading other Terragrunt configuration files
- `read_tfvars_file()` - Reading Terraform variable files
- `sops_decrypt_file()` - Reading encrypted files via SOPS
- `mark_as_read()` - Explicitly marking files as read

You can use tools like `jq` to analyze which components read specific files:

```bash
$ terragrunt find --reading --format=json | jq '[.[] | select(.reading[]? | contains("shared.hcl"))]'
[
  {
    "type": "unit",
    "path": "app",
    "reading": [
      "shared.hcl",
      "shared.tfvars"
    ]
  }
]
```
