Controls how the find results are sorted:

- `alpha` (default): Sort configurations alphabetically by path
- `dag`: Sort configurations based on their dependencies, ensuring dependencies are listed before their dependents

This is particularly useful when you need to understand the dependency order of your Terragrunt configurations.

Example:

```bash
# Sort alphabetically (default)
terragrunt find --sort alpha

# Sort by dependencies (DAG order)
terragrunt find --sort dag
```

When using DAG sorting, configurations with no dependencies appear first, followed by configurations that depend on them:

```bash
terragrunt find --sort dag
unitA           # no dependencies
unitB           # no dependencies
unitC           # depends on unitA
unitD           # depends on unitA and unitB
```
