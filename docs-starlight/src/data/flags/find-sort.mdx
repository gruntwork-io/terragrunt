Controls how the find results are sorted. Currently, the only supported value is `dag` (Directed Acyclic Graph), which sorts units based on their dependencies.

This is particularly useful when you need to understand the dependency order of your Terragrunt units.

Example:

```bash
terragrunt find --sort dag
```
