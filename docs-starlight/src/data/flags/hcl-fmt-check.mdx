When enabled, Terragrunt will check if HCL files are properly formatted without making any changes. This is useful in CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent formatting.

The command will:
- Exit with status code 0 if files are properly formatted
- Exit with status code 1 if any files need formatting

Example:

```bash
terragrunt hcl fmt --check
```
