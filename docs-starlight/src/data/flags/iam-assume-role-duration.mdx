Specifies how long the temporary credentials should remain valid when assuming an IAM role. This flag is only used when [`iam-assume-role`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#iam-assume-role) is specified.

For more information on how to use this flag, and how it differs from other ways of managing authentication with Terragrunt, see the [Authentication](/docs/features/authentication) feature documentation.
