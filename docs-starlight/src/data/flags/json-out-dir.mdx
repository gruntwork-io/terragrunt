description: Directory to store JSON plan files generated from plans via show -json.
type: string
env:
  - TG_JSON_OUT_DIR
---

Generates machine-readable plan outputs per unit as `tfplan.json` by invoking `show -json` after the plan is created.

- Requires a plan to exist (e.g. created with `--out-dir`).
- If the directory does not exist, Terragrunt creates it.
- Relative paths are resolved against the root working directory, and Terragrunt mirrors the unit path under this directory (e.g. `<json-out-dir>/<relative-unit-path>/tfplan.json`).

Examples:

```bash
# Create native plan files and JSON plans for all units
terragrunt run --all --out-dir /tmp/all --json-out-dir /tmp/all plan

# Or store JSON plans separately
terragrunt run --all --out-dir /tmp/plan --json-out-dir /tmp/json plan
```
