Controls whether dependency information is included in the list output. When enabled, Terragrunt will analyze and display the dependency relationships between configurations.

This flag is particularly powerful when combined with different output formats and sorting options:

- With `--format=long`: Shows dependencies in a tabular format
- With `--format=json`: Includes full dependency ancestry in JSON output

<Aside type="tip">
  Combine `--dependencies` with `--sort=dag` and `--group-by=dag` (or just use `--dag`) to get a complete picture of your infrastructure's deployment sequence.
