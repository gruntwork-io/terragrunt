By default, Terragrunt includes hidden directories (those starting with a dot) in the list results. Use this flag to exclude them.

Example:

```bash
# Default: includes hidden directories
$ terragrunt list -l
Type  Path
unit  .hide/unit
stack stack
unit  unit

# With --no-hidden: excludes hidden directories
$ terragrunt list -l --no-hidden
Type  Path
stack stack
unit  unit
```
