Controls how the list results are sorted. Currently, the only supported value is `dag` (Directed Acyclic Graph), which sorts configurations based on their dependencies.

This is particularly useful when you need to understand the dependency order of your Terragrunt configurations.

Example:

```bash
terragrunt list --sort dag
```
