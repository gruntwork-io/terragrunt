When enabled, Terragrunt will disable all logging output. This is useful when you want to see only the OpenTofu/Terraform output or when using Terragrunt in scripts where logging isn't needed.

Note that this automatically enables the `--tf-forward-stdout` flag to ensure OpenTofu/Terraform output is still visible.
