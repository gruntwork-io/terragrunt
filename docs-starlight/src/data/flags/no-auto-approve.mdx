name: no-auto-approve
description: Don't automatically append '-auto-approve' to the underlying OpenTofu/Terraform commands run with 'run --all'.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_NO_AUTO_APPROVE

When enabled, Terragrunt will not automatically append the `-auto-approve` flag to destructive commands like `apply` or `destroy` when running with `--all`. This means you'll be prompted for confirmation before making changes.
