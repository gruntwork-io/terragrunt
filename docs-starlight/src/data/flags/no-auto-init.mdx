description: Don't automatically run init on tofu/terraform commands.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_NO_AUTO_INIT

When enabled, Terragrunt will not automatically run `init` before other OpenTofu/Terraform commands. This means you'll need to manually run `init` when required.

To learn more about how to use this flag, see the [Auto-init](/docs/features/auto-init) feature documentation.
