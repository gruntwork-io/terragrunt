description: Don't automatically run init on tofu/terraform commands.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_NO_AUTO_INIT

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When enabled, Terragrunt will not automatically run `init` before other OpenTofu/Terraform commands.

To learn more about how to use this flag, see the [Auto-init](/docs/features/auto-init) feature documentation.

<Aside type="caution">
When `--no-auto-init` is enabled, you must manually run `terragrunt init` if needed. Terragrunt will fail if it detects that initialization is required but auto-init is disabled.

This is particularly important when using custom plugin directories or when working in CI/CD environments.
