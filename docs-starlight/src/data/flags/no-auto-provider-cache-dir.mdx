description: Disable the auto-provider-cache-dir feature even when the experiment is enabled.

When enabled, Terragrunt will disable the `auto-provider-cache-dir` feature even when the [auto-provider-cache-dir experiment](/docs/reference/experiments#auto-provider-cache-dir) is enabled. This flag allows you to selectively opt-out of the automatic provider caching behavior without having to disable the entire experiment.

This is useful when you want to maintain control over provider caching in specific environments or scenarios while still having the experiment enabled globally.

<Aside type="note">
This flag is particularly useful when the auto-provider-cache-dir experiment becomes stabilized and enabled by default, allowing you to disable it for specific runs where manual provider cache control is needed.
