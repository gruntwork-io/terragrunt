When enabled, Terragrunt will not automatically retry commands that fail with transient errors (like network timeouts). By default, Terragrunt will retry such commands a limited number of times.

To learn more about how Terragrunt handles retries, see the [Errors](/docs/features/runtime-control#errors) section of the [Runtime Control](/docs/features/runtime-control#errors) feature documentation.
