name: no-color
description: Disable color output for both Terragrunt and OpenTofu/Terraform.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_NO_COLOR
---

When enabled, Terragrunt will disable colored output in both its own logs and in OpenTofu/Terraform output. This is useful when running in environments where color codes might cause issues, such as CI/CD pipelines or when redirecting output to files.
