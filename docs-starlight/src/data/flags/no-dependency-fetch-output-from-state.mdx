When enabled, Terragrunt will disable the `dependency-fetch-output-from-state` feature. This flag allows you to selectively opt-out of fetching dependency outputs directly from state files.

This is useful when you want to maintain control over dependency output retrieval in specific environments or scenarios, even when the experiment is enabled globally.
