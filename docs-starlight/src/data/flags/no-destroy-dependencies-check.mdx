  Disables Terragrunt's dependency validation during destroy operations.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_NO_DESTROY_DEPENDENCIES_CHECK

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When enabled, Terragrunt will not verify if there are dependent units that would be affected by destroying the current unit.

This results in faster destroy operations, but may result in orphaned resources.

<Aside type="caution">
Disabling dependency checks during destroy operations can lead to orphaned resources or broken infrastructure dependencies.
