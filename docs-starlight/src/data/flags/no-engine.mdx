env:
  - TG_NO_ENGINE

When enabled, Terragrunt will disable IaC engines. This flag allows you to selectively opt-out of using engines even when the `iac-engine` experiment is enabled.

This is useful when you want to maintain control over engine usage in specific environments or scenarios, or when you need to troubleshoot issues with engine functionality.
