description: Disable automatic stack regeneration before running the stack commands.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_NO_STACK_GENERATE

When enabled, Terragrunt will skip automatic stack regeneration before executing the command.
This is useful when you want to run operations using the existing .terragrunt-stack directory without regenerating it, improving execution speed and avoiding unnecessary changes.
