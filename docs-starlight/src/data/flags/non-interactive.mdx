When enabled, Terragrunt will automatically answer "yes" to any prompts that would normally require user input. This is particularly useful in automated environments or CI/CD pipelines where user interaction isn't possible.

<Aside type="caution">
When using `--non-interactive`, Terragrunt will automatically answer "yes" to all prompts except for external dependency inclusion prompts.

These will default to "no" for safety. Use [`--queue-include-external`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-include-external) to explicitly include external dependencies.
