Specifies where Terragrunt writes native OpenTofu/Terraform plan files for each unit when running stack operations.

- Plans are written as `tfplan.tfplan` per unit.
- If the directory does not exist, Terragrunt creates it.
- Relative paths are resolved against the root working directory, and Terragrunt mirrors the unit path under this directory (e.g. `<out-dir>/<relative-unit-path>/tfplan.tfplan`).

Examples:

```bash
# Save plans for all units under /tmp/tfplan
terragrunt run --all plan --out-dir /tmp/tfplan

# Apply using the previously generated plans (per-unit paths are inferred)
terragrunt run --all apply --out-dir /tmp/tfplan
```

See the [Stacks](/docs/features/stacks#saving-opentofuterraform-plan-output) docs for more usage examples.
