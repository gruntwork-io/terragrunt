Sets the maximum number of concurrent operations when running commands with `--all`. This helps control resource usage and API rate limits when working with multiple units.

<Aside type="caution">
When using `--parallelism` with provider caching, `terraform init` is always executed sequentially if OpenTofu/Terraform provider plugin cache is configured.

To safely run concurrent operations with provider caching, enable the [Provider Cache Server](/docs/features/provider-cache-server/) instead.
