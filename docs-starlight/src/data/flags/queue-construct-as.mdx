Sort output based on the dependency graph, as if a particular command was run. This flag implies the `--dag` flag.

The flag has a shorter alias `--as`.

## Usage

```bash
--queue-construct-as=COMMAND
--as=COMMAND
```

Where `COMMAND` is the command to simulate (e.g., `plan`, `destroy`).

## Examples

Sort output as if running plan command (dependencies after dependents):
```bash
terragrunt find --queue-construct-as=plan
```

Sort output as if running destroy command (dependencies before dependents):
```bash
terragrunt find --queue-construct-as=destroy
```

## Behavior

When using `plan` command, all dependent units will appear *after* the units they depend on.

When using `destroy` command, all dependent units will appear *before* the units they depend on.

**Note:** This flag implies the `--dag` flag.
