Specifies directories to exclude when running commands with [`all`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#all).

This flag can be specified multiple times to exclude multiple directories. When using the `TG_QUEUE_EXCLUDE_DIR` environment variable, specify the directories as a comma-separated list.

To learn more about how to use this flag, see the [Stacks](/docs/features/stacks/#the-run---all-command) feature documentation.
