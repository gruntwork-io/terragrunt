When enabled, Terragrunt will exclude external dependencies (dependencies outside the current working directory) from the queue when running commands with [`all`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#all).

Note that an external dependency is a dependency that is outside the current Terragrunt working directory and is not within any directories specified by [`queue-include-dir`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-include-dir).

This flag is useful when you want to limit the scope of execution to only units within your current working directory structure.
