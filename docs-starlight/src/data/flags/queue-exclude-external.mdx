<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecated">
This flag is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Terragrunt. External dependencies are now excluded by default, making this flag unnecessary.

Use [`--queue-include-external`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-include-external) if you need to include external dependencies.
</Aside>

When enabled, Terragrunt will exclude external dependencies (dependencies outside the current working directory) from the queue when running commands with [`--all`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#all).

Note that an external dependency is a dependency that is outside the current Terragrunt working directory and is not within any directories specified by [`queue-include-dir`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-include-dir).
