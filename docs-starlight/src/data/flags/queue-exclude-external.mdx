<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecated">
This flag is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Terragrunt. External dependencies are now excluded by default, making this flag unnecessary.

Use [`--filter` flag](/reference/cli/commands/run#filter) with the expression `{./**}...` if you need to include external dependencies.
