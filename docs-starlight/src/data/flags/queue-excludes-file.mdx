description: Path to a file with a list of directories that need to be excluded when running `run --all` commands.
type: string
defaultVal: .terragrunt-excludes
env:
  - TG_QUEUE_EXCLUDES_FILE

Units in these directories will be excluded during execution of the commands. If a relative path is specified, it should be relative from
[--working-dir](/docs/reference/cli/global-flags#working-directory). This will only exclude the module, not its dependencies.

This flag has been designed to integrate nicely with the `hcl validate` command, which can return a list of invalid files delimited by newlines when passed the `--show-config-path` flag. To integrate the two, you can run something like the following using bash process substitution:

```bash
terragrunt run --all plan --queue-excludes-file <(terragrunt hcl validate --show-config-path || true)
```
