When enabled, Terragrunt will ignore the dependency order when running commands with [`--all`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#all). This means units will be executed in arbitrary order, which can be useful for read-only operations like `plan`.

Note that this can lead to errors if used with commands that modify state, as dependencies might be processed in the wrong order.

To learn more about how to use this flag, see the [Stacks](/docs/features/stacks/#the-run---all-command) feature documentation.
