When enabled, Terragrunt will continue processing remaining units even if one fails. This can be useful when you want to see all potential errors in your configuration, rather than stopping at the first failure.

Note that this may lead to incomplete or inconsistent states if used with commands that modify infrastructure.

To learn more about how to use this flag, see the [Stacks](/docs/features/stacks/#the-run---all-command) feature documentation.

<Aside type="danger">
Using `--queue-ignore-errors` can lead to inconsistent state if dependencies fail but dependent modules continue running.

Use this flag with caution, especially with `apply` or `destroy` commands.

For more fine-grained error handling, see the [errors block](/docs/reference/hcl/blocks#errors) in the HCL reference.
