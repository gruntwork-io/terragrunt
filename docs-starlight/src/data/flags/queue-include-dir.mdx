Specifies directories to include when running commands with [`--all`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#all).

This flag can be specified multiple times to include multiple directories. When using the `TG_QUEUE_INCLUDE_DIR` environment variable, specify the directories as a comma-separated list.

To learn more about how to use this flag, see the [Stacks](/docs/features/stacks/#the-run---all-command) feature documentation.
