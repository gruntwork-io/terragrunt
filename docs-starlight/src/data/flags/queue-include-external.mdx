By default, Terragrunt excludes external dependencies (dependencies discovered outside the current working directory) from the queue when running commands with [`--all`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#all) or [`--graph`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#graph).

When this flag is enabled, Terragrunt will include those external dependencies in the queue.

This flag is useful when you have units that depend on infrastructure outside your current working directory and need those dependencies to be processed as part of the run.
