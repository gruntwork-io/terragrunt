This flag works very similarly to the [`--queue-units-that-include`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-units-that-include) flag, but instead of looking only for included configurations,
it also looks for configurations that read a given file.

When passed in, the `--all` command will include all units (modules) that read a given file into the queue. This is useful
when you want to trigger an update on all units that read or include a given file using HCL functions in their configurations.

Consider the following folder structure:

<FileTree>

- reading-shared-hcl
  - terragrunt.hcl
- also-reading-shared-hcl
  - terragrunt.hcl
- not-reading-shared-hcl
  - terragrunt.hcl
- shared.hcl

</FileTree>

Suppose that `reading-shared-hcl` and `also-reading-shared-hcl` both read `shared.hcl` in their configurations, like so:

```hcl
# terragrunt.hcl

locals {
 shared = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("shared.hcl"))
}
```

If you run the command `run --all init --queue-include-units-reading shared.hcl` from the root folder, both
`reading-shared-hcl` and `also-reading-shared-hcl` will be run; not `not-reading-shared-hcl`.

This is because the `read_terragrunt_config` HCL function has a special hook that allows Terragrunt to track that it has
read the file `shared.hcl`. This hook is used by all native HCL functions that Terragrunt supports which read files.

Note, however, that there are certain scenarios where Terragrunt may not be able to track that a file has been read this way.

For example, you may be using a bash script to read a file via [`run_cmd`](/docs/reference/hcl/functions/#run_cmd), or reading the file via OpenTofu code. To support these
use-cases, the [`mark_as_read`](/docs/reference/hcl/functions/#mark_as_read) function can be used to manually mark a file as read.

That would look something like this:

```hcl
# terragrunt.hcl

locals {
  filename = mark_as_read("file-read-by-tofu.txt")
}

inputs = {
  filename = local.filename
}
```
<Aside type="caution">
Due to how Terragrunt parses configurations during `run-all`, functions will only properly mark files as read if they are used in the `locals` block.

Reading a file directly in the `inputs` block will not mark the file as read, as the `inputs` block is not evaluated until after the queue has already been populated.
