When enabled, Terragrunt will only process directories that match the patterns specified by [`--queue-include-dir`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-include-dir).

For example, with the following directory structure:

<FileTree>

- prod
  - app
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - db
    - terragrunt.hcl
- staging
  - app
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - db
    - terragrunt.hcl

</FileTree>

Running `terragrunt run --all plan --queue-include-dir "prod/*"` would process all directories, but the [`--all`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#all) flag includes by default when no [excludes](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#queue-exclude-dir) are provided, so the `stage` stack would also be included by default.

Running `terragrunt run --all plan --queue-include-dir "prod/*" --queue-strict-include` tells Terragrunt to exclude by default, so it only include units `prod/app` and `prod/db`.

<Aside type="danger">
When using `--queue-strict-include`, all dependencies of included directories will be excluded if they are not explicitly included. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful with your include patterns.

Always verify the modules that will be included before running destructive commands.
