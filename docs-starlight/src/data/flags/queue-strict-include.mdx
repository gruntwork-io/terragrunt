import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When enabled, Terragrunt will only process directories that match the patterns specified by [`--queue-include-dir`](#queue-include-dir).

For example, with the following directory structure:

<FileTree>

- prod
  - app
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - db
    - terragrunt.hcl
- staging
  - app
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - db
    - terragrunt.hcl

</FileTree>

Running `terragrunt run --all plan --queue-include-dir "prod/*"` would process all directories, but the [`--all`](#all) flag includes by default when no [excludes](#queue-exclude-dir) are provided, so the `stage` stack would also be included by default.

Running `terragrunt run --all plan --queue-include-dir "prod/*" --queue-strict-include` tells Terragrunt to exclude by default, so it only include units `prod/app` and `prod/db`.
