Example:

```bash
terragrunt render --all --json
```

This will render all configurations discovered from the current working directory and write the rendered configurations to `terragrunt.rendered.json` files adjacent to the configurations they are derived from.

Combining this with the `--write` flag will write the rendered configurations to `terragrunt.rendered.json` files adjacent to the configurations they are derived from.

```bash
terragrunt render -a --json --write
```
