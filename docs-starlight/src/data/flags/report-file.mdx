By default, the format of the report will be automatically detected based on the file extension. A `.csv` extension will generate a CSV report, and a `.json` extension will generate a JSON report. Anything else will default to generating a CSV report.

To explicitly specify the format of the report, use the [report-format](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run/#report-format) flag.

For more information, see the [Run Report](/docs/features/run-report) feature.
