When enabled, Terragrunt will disable hooks when processing boilerplate templates during scaffolding operations.

This is useful for security reasons when you want to prevent templates from executing arbitrary hooks on your system.

Examples:

```bash
terragrunt scaffold github.com/org/repo//modules/mysql --no-hooks
```
