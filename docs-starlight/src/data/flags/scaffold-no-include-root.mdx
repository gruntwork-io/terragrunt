name: no-include-root
description: Disable inclusion of the root module in the generated `terragrunt.hcl` file (equivalent to using `--var=EnableRootInclude=false`, and will be overridden if the corresponding `var` value is set).
type: bool
env:
  - TG_NO_INCLUDE_ROOT
---

When enabled, Terragrunt will not automatically include the root configuration file in generated `terragrunt.hcl` files during scaffolding operations.

This is equivalent to setting `--var=EnableRootInclude=false` and will be overridden if that variable is explicitly set.

Example:

```bash
terragrunt scaffold github.com/org/repo//modules/mysql --no-include-root
```
