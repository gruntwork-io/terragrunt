When enabled, Terragrunt will disable shell commands when processing boilerplate templates during scaffolding operations.

This is useful for security reasons when you want to prevent templates from executing arbitrary shell commands on your system.

<Aside type="caution">
Do not use catalog/scaffold to scaffold untrusted templates. IaC configurations are inherently powerful, as they
can run arbitrary code on your system, so make sure to only use trusted templates you have reviewed and approved.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
Note that you will otherwise be prompted to confirm the execution of each shell command unless you are running in [non-interactive mode](/docs/reference/cli/global-flags/#non-interactive).
</Aside>

Examples:

```bash
terragrunt scaffold github.com/org/repo//modules/mysql --no-shell
```
