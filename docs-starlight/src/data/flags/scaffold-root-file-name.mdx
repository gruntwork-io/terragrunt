description: Set the name of the root configuration file to include in the generated `terragrunt.hcl` file.
type: string
env:
  - TG_ROOT_FILE_NAME
---

Specifies the name of the root configuration file to include in generated `terragrunt.hcl` files during scaffolding. This is equivalent to using `--var=RootFileName=<name>`, and will be overridden if the corresponding `var` value is set.

Example:

```bash
terragrunt scaffold github.com/org/repo//modules/mysql --root-file-name root.hcl
```
