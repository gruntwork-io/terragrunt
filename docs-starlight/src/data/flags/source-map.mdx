name: source-map
description: Replace any source URL (including the source URL of a config pulled in with dependency blocks) that has root source with dest.
type: string
env:
  - TG_SOURCE_MAP
---

Allows you to replace source URLs that match a specified pattern with a different URL. This affects both direct source references and sources specified in dependency blocks.

The format is `source-regex=replacement-source`.

For example:

```bash
terragrunt run plan --source-map "git::ssh://git@github.com/org/repo.git=../local/repo"
```

This will replace any source URL that matches `github.com/example/infrastructure//modules/vpc` with `github.com/example/infrastructure//modules/vpc-new`.
