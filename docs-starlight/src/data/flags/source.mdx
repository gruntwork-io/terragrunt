Specifies a source URL where Terragrunt should download the OpenTofu/Terraform configuration. This overrides any `source` parameters specified in the Terragrunt configuration files.

The configuration will be downloaded into a temporary folder, and Terragrunt will execute OpenTofu/Terraform commands in that folder.

Example:

```bash
terragrunt run plan --source github.com/example/infrastructure//modules/vpc
```

This is particularly useful when:

- Testing changes to modules without modifying the source in your configuration.
- Using a specific version or branch of your infrastructure modules.
- Running configurations from a different source than what's specified in your Terragrunt files.
