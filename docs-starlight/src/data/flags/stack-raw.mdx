A convenience flag that formats the stack output as a raw string. This is equivalent to using `--format raw`.

This is particularly useful when you need to use the output in shell scripts or other automation.

Example:

```bash
# Store the output in a variable
APP_ID=$(terragrunt stack output --raw app.id)
```
