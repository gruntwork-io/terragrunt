Enables specific strict controls in Terragrunt. For a list of available controls and their descriptions, run `terragrunt info strict`.

This flag provides finer-grained control compared to `--strict-mode`, allowing you to enable specific controls rather than all of them.

For more information, see the [strict controls documentation](/docs/reference/strict-controls).
