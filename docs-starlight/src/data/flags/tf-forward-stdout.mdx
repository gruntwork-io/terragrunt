name: tf-forward-stdout
description: If specified, the output of OpenTofu/Terraform commands will be printed as is, without being integrated into the Terragrunt log.
type: bool
env:
  - TG_TF_FORWARD_STDOUT

By default, Terragrunt integrates OpenTofu/Terraform output into its own logging system. When this flag is enabled, OpenTofu/Terraform output will be printed directly to stdout without Terragrunt's logging wrapper.

For example, without `--tf-forward-stdout`:

```bash
14:19:25.081 INFO   [app] Running command: tofu plan -input=false
14:19:25.174 STDOUT [app] tofu: OpenTofu used the selected providers to generate the following execution
14:19:25.174 STDOUT [app] tofu: plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
14:19:25.174 STDOUT [app] tofu:   + create
14:19:25.174 STDOUT [app] tofu: OpenTofu will perform the following actions:
```

With `--tf-forward-stdout`:

```bash
14:19:25.081 INFO   [app] Running command: tofu plan -input=false

OpenTofu used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

OpenTofu will perform the following actions:
```
