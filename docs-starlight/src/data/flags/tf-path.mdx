name: tf-path
description: Path to the OpenTofu/Terraform binary. Default is tofu (on PATH).
type: string
env:
  - TG_TF_PATH

Specifies the path to the OpenTofu/Terraform binary that Terragrunt should use. By default, Terragrunt will look for a binary named `tofu` in your system's PATH.

This is useful when:

- You have multiple versions of OpenTofu/Terraform installed.
- The binary is not in your PATH.
- You want to use a specific version for certain operations.
- You want to switch between OpenTofu and Terraform binaries.

Example:

```bash
terragrunt run plan --tf-path=/usr/local/bin/tofu
```

Note that if you only have `terraform` installed, and it is available in your `PATH`, Terragrunt will automatically use that binary.

NOTE: This will override the terraform binary that is used by terragrunt in all instances, including dependency lookups. This setting will also override any terraform_binary configuration values specified in the terragrunt.hcl config for both the top level, and dependency lookups.
