import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When specified, Terragrunt will only run commands against units that include the specified configuration file. This is useful for targeting specific configurations that share common included files.

For example, with the following directory structure:

<FileTree>
- dev
  - app
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - db
    - terragrunt.hcl
- prod
  - app
    - terragrunt.hcl
  - db
    - terragrunt.hcl
- _envcommon
  - app.hcl
  - db.hcl
</FileTree>

If both `dev/app/terragrunt.hcl` and `prod/app/terragrunt.hcl` include files from `_envcommon`, you can target all units that include the `app.hcl` file:

```bash
terragrunt run --all --units-that-include=./_envcommon/app.hcl plan
```

This will only run the command against units that include the `app.hcl` file.

Note: This flag is functionally covered by the `--queue-include-units-reading` flag, but is more explicitly focused on the `include` configuration block.
