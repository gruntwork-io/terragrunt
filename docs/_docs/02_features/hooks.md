## Before and After Hooks

*Before Hooks* or *After Hooks* are a feature of terragrunt that make it possible to define custom actions that will be called either before or after execution of the `terraform` command.

Hereâ€™s an example:

``` hcl
terraform {
  before_hook "before_hook" {
    commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
    execute      = ["echo", "Running Terraform"]
  }

  after_hook "after_hook" {
    commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
    execute      = ["echo", "Finished running Terraform"]
    run_on_error = true
  }
}
```

In this example configuration, whenever Terragrunt runs `terraform apply` or `terraform plan`, two things will happen:

- Before Terragrunt runs `terraform`, it will output `Running Terraform` to the console.
- After Terragrunt runs `terraform`, it will output `Finished running Terraform`, regardless of whether or not the
  command failed.

You can have multiple before and after hooks. Each hook will execute in the order they are defined. For example:

``` hcl
terraform {
  before_hook "before_hook_1" {
    commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
    execute      = ["echo", "Will run Terraform"]
  }

  before_hook "before_hook_2" {
    commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
    execute      = ["echo", "Running Terraform"]
  }
}
```

This configuration will cause Terragrunt to output `Will run Terraform` and then `Running Terraform` before the call
to Terraform.

You can learn more about all the various configuration options supported in [the reference docs for the terraform
block](/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#terraform).

### Tflint hook

*Before Hooks* or *After Hooks* support natively *tflint*, a linter for Terraform code. It will validate the
Terraform code used by Terragrunt, and it's inputs.

Here's an example:
```hcl
terraform {
  before_hook "before_hook" {
    commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
    execute      = ["tflint"]
  }
}
```

The `.tflint.hcl` should exist in the same folder as `terragrunt.hcl` or one of it's parents. If Terragrunt can't find
a `.tflint.hcl` file, it won't execute tflint and return an error.
```hcl
plugin "aws" {
    enabled = true
    version = "0.21.0"
    source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-aws"
}
```

#### Configuration

The `execute` parameter only accepts `tflint`, it will ignore any other parameter. Any desired extra configuration should be added in the `.tflint.hcl` file. It will work with a `.tflint.hcl` file in the current folder or any parent folder.

#### Authentication for tflint rulesets 
*Public rulesets*

`tflint` works without any authentication for public rulesets (hosted on public repositories).

*Private rulesets*

If you want to run a the `tflint` hook with custom rulesets defined in a private repository, you will need to export locally a valid `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` token. Terragrunt will take that and expose it to the `tflint`-recognised authentication token - `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

#### Troubleshooting

**`flag provided but not defined: -act-as-bundled-plugin` error**

If you have an `.tflint.hcl` file that is empty, or uses the `terraform` ruleset without version or source constraint, it returns the following error:
```
Failed to initialize plugins; Unrecognized remote plugin message: Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -act-as-bundled-plugin
```

To fix this, make sure that the configuration for the `terraform` ruleset, in the `.tflint.hcl` file contains a version constraint:
```
plugin "terraform" {
    enabled = true
    version = "0.2.1"
    source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-terraform"
}
```

## Error Hooks
*Error hooks* are a special type of after hook that act as exception handlers. They allow you to specify a list of expressions that can be used to catch errors and run custom commands when those errors occur. Error hooks are executed after the before/after hooks.

Here is an example:
``` hcl
terraform {
  error_hook "import_resource" {
    commands  = ["apply"]
    execute   = ["echo", "Error Hook executed"]
    on_errors = [
      ".*",
    ]
  }
}
```
