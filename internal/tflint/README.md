# tflint

This package allows us to embed [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) in Terragrunt, enabling it to be natively executed from the before and after hooks without having to install `tflint` separately. Since `tflint` is licensed with MPL, we are required to let you know where you can find its source code: <https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint>.
